# Handwriting-Recognition
The IAM Handwriting Database is a publicly accessible and freely available dataset that is widely used for research purposes. It contains handwritten forms, text lines, sentences, and words, providing a rich resource for studying handwriting recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), and related fields.

Dataset Description: The IAM Handwriting Database is hierarchically structured into different categories. The dataset includes the following components:

Forms: This category contains form images, where each image represents a complete handwritten form. The forms are named following the LOB Corpus naming scheme, such as “a01-122.png”.

Text Lines: The text lines category contains individual lines of text extracted from the form images. Each line is saved as a separate image, following a similar naming convention as the forms.

Sentences: This category contains sentences, with one sentence corresponding to each text line image. The sentences provide additional context and can be used for higher-level analysis.

Words: This category includes individual words extracted from the text lines. Similar to text lines, each word is saved as an image.

ASCII and XML: These categories contain meta-information about the forms, lines, sentences, and words in ASCII and XML formats, respectively. They provide summarized information about the dataset, including labels, coordinates, and other relevant details.
