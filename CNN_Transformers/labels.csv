642,de Gaulle's official welcome last week
643,to Britain's moves towards the Six was
644,"taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall ,"
645,but no more than that .
646,So the idea of personal mission by
647,the Prime Minister to Paris was dropped
648,Instead Mr. Macmillan will rely on a
649,hand-picked team under the leadership of
650,"Sir Pierson Dixon , Britain's Ambassador to"
651,"France , to back Mr. Edward Heath , Lord"
652,"Privy Seal , who is charged with the conduct"
653,of negotiations with the Six . At the same
654,time the Prime Minister has offered
655,Commonwealth Governments every facility possible to
656,safeguard their interests
657,"Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys ,"
658,"Commonwealth Relations Secretary , that they wish to be kept"
659,"in touch in London . Three of them - Canada , Australia ,"
660,New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening
661,meeting in London on Monday . Once the Common
662,Market's Council of Ministers draws up the procedure
663,"for negotiations in a fortnight's time , these Commonwealth"
664,countries can arrange for observers to advise the British
665,negotiating team .
666,The team is composed of experienced
667,negotiators in several fields . Sir Pier-
668,son Dixon has a wide reputation as
669,a skilful backstage negotiator since
670,his days as Britain's chief UN dele-
671,gate . Second in command is Mr.
672,"Eric Roll , 53-year-old Deputy Secre-"
673,"tary at the Ministry of Agriculture ,"
674,"Food , and Fisheries . The Foreign Office"
675,is represented by Sir Roderick Barclay
676,Other leading members are : Sir Henry Lintott from
677,"the Commonwealth Relations Office , Sir William"
678,"Corell-Barnes ( Colonial Office ) , Mr. G. R. Bell"
679,"( Treasury ) , and Mr. G. H. Andrew ( Board of Trade ) ."
680,They will accompany Mr. Heath next month when
681,"he goes to Brussels , headquarters of the Common"
682,"Market Commission , or wherever the Six decide"
683,negotiations should be held .
684,Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a
685,"meeting in Paris between M. Couve de Murville , French"
686,"Foreign Minister , and Mr. Heath . MR. Selwyn Lloyd -"
687,a man with troubles enough back home - seems
688,fated to fly into trouble abroad . Last year it was
689,"the riots in Istanbul , which enlivened the NATO"
690,Council meeting .
691,Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in
692,Ghana coinciding with the meeting of the Com-
693,monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the
694,first to be held in Africa . Only a few hours af-
695,ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed
696,"at Accra this morning , hundreds of shop assistants"
697,demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway
698,"Stores , the largest in town ."
699,The stores had been hit by the same strike wave
700,that has paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past
701,"week . Root of the discontent : The austerity Budget ,"
702,including a compulsory savings scheme which the
703,Ghana Government introduced in July . Ghana's strong
704,"man is not here to face the storm . President Nkrumah ,"
705,having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference
706,"in Belgrade , has resumed his holiday on the Black"
707,Sea and no one here professes to know when he
708,will return .
709,But in his absence his chief lieutenants have
710,not let him down . The strong arm of authority has
711,been raised against the strikers and is now beginning
712,"to tell . Today's Ghanaian Times ( motto : "" The welfare"
713,"of the people is the supreme law "" ) reports : "" The"
714,Government has been urged to take immediate ac-
715,"tion to deal ruthlessly with the strikers . """
716,The urge came from a conference of activists of
717,"Nkrumah's Convention Party "" after powerful addresses"
718,"by Comrades Krobo Edusei , Tawia Adamafio , "" and"
719,others . Strong deeds followed strong words . In Takoradi
720,"a "" limited state of emergency "" was declared , giving"
721,the Government adequate power to maintain all
722,essential services and ensure food supplies . Thus it
723,becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment
724,"for anyone who "" publishes a report likely to cause"
725,"alarm or prejudicial to public safety . """
726,And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed
727,on anyone convicted of sabotage . These stern measures
728,had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the
729,"strikers gave in , but in Takoradi , the chief storm centre ,"
730,"they are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400"
731,police and 16 armoured cars . And how did the
732,Government react when the strikers demonstrated in
733,Accra ?
734,"At 9.40 Mr. Edusei , Minister of Transport and pro-"
735,"bably the toughest man in Mr. Nkrumah's team ,"
736,drove up to the Kingsway Stores and faced the
737,"demonstrators , most of them shopgirls in overalls ."
738,""" If you have not dispersed by ten o'clock , "" he"
739,"told them , ' the police will act . ' At five to ten"
740,a posse of police arrived and in less than
741,two minutes the crowd had gone .
742,"If the threatened "" counter-revolution "" was not * to bring"
743,the President back from his travels it might have been
744,thought that the muster from the 13 States of the
745,Commonwealth was an occasion worthy of his presence .
746,After all it was Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this
747,year the Economic Consultative Council should meet
748,in Accra .

751,"Minister , to do the honours as host , in which capacity"
752,he held a reception tonight in Accra's Ambassador
753,"Hotel . POLICE , on direct orders from the Cabinet , are"
754,openly intimidating members of Earl Russell's nuclear-
755,"disarming Committee of 100 , the Committee claimed"
756,yesterday . It said pressure was being put on
757,members and associates all over the country .
758,It alleged : Phones were being tapped and
759,going out of action ; Police were visiting
760,"people "" on no pretext whatsoever , except"
761,"to pass the time of day "" ; Supporters had"
762,been warned - one that his connection
763,with the committee was going too far ; another
764,that anti-apartheid agitation was
765,"all right , but support for the committee"
766,was not .
767,A third man's house was watched for four days
768,by plain-clothes men . Committee-member Mr. George
769,"Clark commented at a Press conference : "" The"
770,"most extraordinary things are happening . "" Fifty"

792,was planned but police turned up .
793,Sir Roy Welensky said today that he no
794,longer accepted the good faith of Mr. Kenneth
795,"Kaunda . Sir Roy , Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister ,"
796,said that Mr. Kaunda's United National Independence
797,Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia
798,"National Congress , which was led by Mr. Kaunda"
799,until he was outlawed in 1959 . The record
800,of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went
801,"back a long way , Sir Roy told the"
802,Federal Parliament in Salisbury .
803,He cited cases in which hundreds of UNIP supporters
804,had been arrested or convicted since last year on
805,charges of creating disturbances . During the first
806,three weeks of the present trouble 287 incidents
807,had been reported in Northern Rhodesia . More
808,than 500 people - 167 of them members of
809,the UNIP - were convicted last month in the
810,Northern Province alone .
811,""" Against this background must be taken Mr."
812,Kaunda's repeated statements that all he is
813,"doing is in the name of non-violence , "" said"
814,"Sir Roy . "" I am now compelled to say that"
815,"I don't accept his good faith . "" He said"
816,Mr. Kaunda must know that his statements
817,"had stimulated violence , but he had done"
818,nothing to stop it .
819,""" It is true he made a point of again being absent"
820,from Northern Rhodesia when his followers have
821,"indulged in such violence . "" But Sir Roy pointed out"
822,that a few months ago Mr. Kaunda said that
823,if UNIP did not get its way what would happen
824,"would make the Mau Mau in Kenya "" seem like a"
825,"child's picnic . """
826,JOHN DICKIE writes : Mr. Macmillan gave top
827,priority to the clash over Northern Rhodesia on his
828,return from Scotland yesterday . He summoned Mr.
829,"Iain Macleod , Colonial Secretary , and Mr. Duncan Sandys ,"
830,Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour's talks
831,at Admiralty House . A statement is expected today
832,to hold the door open for modifications to the
833,new Constitution provided law and order is maintained
834,in Northern Rhodesia .
835,Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting
836,problem . Mr. Sandys has warned of the risk of a
837,strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky to any
838,suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to the
839,African nationalists . Mr. Macleod has ample evidence
840,"from talks with Sir John Moffat , Northern Rhodesian"
841,"Liberal leader , and Mr. Kaunda , that the bulk"
842,of moderates and Africans will reject the
843,Constitution unless it is modified .
844,A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of
845,Buganda ( King Freddie ) from Princess
846,"Elizabeth Bagaya of Toro , kneeling at the"
847,foot of his airliner's steps at London Airport

849,"kneeling with heads bowed . The princess ,"

852,of Gloucester .
853,King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of
854,native kingdoms in Uganda arrived for talks with
855,"Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod , before the"
856,Uganda Constitutional conference opens next Monday .
857,The question : Their status in an independent Uganda .
858,The thorniest problem for next week's conference is
859,to settle the relationships between them and the
860,rest of the country . A Government report has
861,recognised their rights and recommended a form of
862,"federal association , but the four kings are not"
863,"Instead , the kings will remain in London"
864,and wait to hear the conference's proposals .
865,Then their views will be transmitted back .
866,"MR. BUTLER , the Home Secretary , has decided"
867,to meet head-on the biggest challenge to
868,Government authority yet presented by the
869,""" Ban-the-Bomb "" demonstrators . Police leave"
870,has been cancelled and secret plans prepared
871,to deal with the mass sit-down rally planned
872,for Sunday in Parliament-square by the
873,"Committee of 100 , the anti-nuclear arms"
874,group .
875,It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which
876,ended yesterday in 32 members of the
877,Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting
878,a breach of the peace . The committee's
879,president 89-year-old Earl Russell and
880,his 61-year-old wife were each jailed for
881,a week . Playwrights Arnold Wesker ( The Kitchen )
882,and Robert Bolt ( The Flowering Cherry ) were
883,jailed for a month .
884,The possibility that the Government might
885,"invoke the Public Order Act , 1936 , and"
886,declare the whole rally illegal - whether
887,the demonstrators sit down or not - was
888,being discussed in Whitehall last night .
889,"It was last used a year ago , to deal"
890,with the St. Pancras rent riots . Today
891,Mr. Butler will have talks with Police
892,Commissioner Sir Joseph Simpson to
893,"draw up final plans for the "" Battle"
894,"of Parliament Square . """
895,Measures agreed so far include : 1 . A mass
896,"call-out of police , special constables"
897,"and reserves , with 750 policemen posted"
898,from outlying districts to stations in
899,"the area - West End Central , Bow-street ,"
900,and Cannon-row .
901,"Today , for example , the Foreign Minister of Indo-"
902,nesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav
903,Foreign Minister . In fact such Yugoslav activity has
904,been # particularly intensified in the past year
905,"or so and though so far , apart from joint action"
906,"in the United Nations , these exchanges have not"
907,"been seen on any wider basis , President Tito"
908,is known for some time to have favoured a
909,conference of neutralist leaders .
910,The wish was particularly apparent in comments
911,"on the occasion of the conference in Casablanca and ,"
912,"in particular , in Yugoslav approval of the idea of an"
913,inter-African consultative assembly which would
914,coordinate activity on the political and economic
915,sphere ; and it is not difficult to see that President
916,Tito would like some such idea extended also
917,to the whole uncommitted world
918,"But he now feels , in view of a changed international"
919,situation and especially in view of fresh problems facing
920,"the new and independent countries of Africa , that the"
921,time is ripe to have more frequent consultations between
922,the uncommitted countries and even to work out common
923,stands on various problems facing those nations . Two
924,"subjects , the Congo and Algeria , are the main topics"
925,of the talks in Belgrade - and on both the two
926,leaders have identical ideas .
927,Two emissaries from the Laotian Government
928,of Prince Boun Oum have arrived in
929,"Phnom Penh , Cambodia , to invite Prince"
930,"Souvanna Phouma , the former Prime Min-"
931,"ister , to return to Laos . No details of"
932,"their mission have been disclosed , but it"
933,was reported earlier in Laos that Prince
934,Boun Oum was considering asking
935,Prince Souvanna Phouma to join his
936,Government .
937,Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to
938,"the mission , but recent statements made by him"
939,in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards
940,himself as the only legal Prime Minister of
941,Laos . His policy of strict neutrality from 1951
942,"to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace , though"
943,at the cost of virtual partition of the country
944,into the pro-communist north and the
945,pro-western centre and south .
946,Prince Souvanna's former Minister of
947,"Information , Mr. Quinim Pholsena , who"
948,claims to be his representative in
949,"Laos , yesterday addressed all officers"
950,of the pro-communist forces
951,occupying the province of Xieng
952,Khouang and emphasized that
953,"Prince Souphannouvong , leader"
954,of the pro-communist Neo Lao
955,"Haksat Party , also to the officers"
956,in the same terms .
957,This emphasis on the legality of the former
958,Government suggests that all is not well
959,with the political and military leadership
960,of the pro-communists . Most of the
961,province of Xieng Khouang and the
962,"tactically useful Plain of Jars , however ,"
963,appear still to be firmly in their hands .
964,The Government has claimed the
965,"recapture of Vang Vieng , the pro-"
966,communists' former base 60 miles
967,"north of Vientiane , but this claim"
968,A correspondent who travelled yesterday to within
969,a few miles of Vang Vieng was told by officers that
970,this village was still held by the pro-communists .
971,With the Prime Minister sunning himself in Jamaica
972,and # his Cabinet out in the grass roots making
973,"160 speeches in 80 constituencies in 10 days , the Liberal"
974,Party are holding a national conference here with
975,"some 2,000 delegates , the biggest gathering since 1958"
976,when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party
977,leader .
978,In some ways it will be a testing occasion
979,"for him , although some think his position"
980,unassailable simply because there is no one
981,else in sight to supplant him . So the con-
982,ference will concentrate on laying the
983,foundations on which to win the next
984,election . The rally comes at a time
985,when in spite of carefully worded state-
986,ments by the Prime Minister there is an
987,air of electoral expectancy .
988,Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on
989,a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks
990,which outlines in some detail the accomplishments
991,of the party since it came to office three and
992,a half years ago . Nevertheless there is little
993,illusion in the Conservative Party that their
994,stock at home has fallen in the face of
995,heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy .
996,Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative
997,"provincial governments , Quebec and New Brunswick , and"
998,in the four federal by-elections last October the party
999,fared badly . They are now faced with four other by-
1000,"elections , one at Esquimalt Saanich , British Columbia ,"
1001,"one in Leeds , Ontario , and the other two in the"
1002,"Maritimes - Restigouche Madawaska , New Brunswick ,"
1003,"and Kings , Prince Edward Island ."
1004,All four were Conservative strongholds . Last September
1005,a public poll showed that for the first time since
1006,the Administration came to power in 1957 the
1007,Liberals were ahead ( 43 per cent were in favour
1008,"of "" The Grits "" if a federal election had been"
1009,"held last autumn , 38 per cent for the"
1010,Conservatives and 12 per cent for the C.C.F. ) .
1011,"However , a separate poll revealed that Mr."
1012,Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of
1013,popularity as an individual leader ( for
1014,"Mr. Diefenbaker 36 per cent , for Mr."
1015,Pearson 34 per cent ) . How far is Mr.
1016,Lester Pearson acceptable to the people
1017,of Canada as a Prime Minister ? Many

1212,defence of the Polaris missile base . And by
1213,implication he supported the establishment of
1214,sites in Britain for the training of German
1215,troops . His main theme was that nuclear
1216,"weapons were necessary to defend Britain , that"
1217,"Britain must depend on Nato and "" the West """
1218,must have nuclear weapons so long as the
1219,Soviet Union has them .
1220,Addressing the annual congress of the National Union
1221,"of General and Municipal Workers , he said he felt"
1222,sure the Labour movement was coming round in
1223,support of his views . Obviously conscious of the fierce and
1224,widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in
1225,"Britain , Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that"
1226,supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing
1227,their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on
1228,to the missile .
1229,Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could
1230,not deny facilities to nations to which it was
1231,allied . But governments should be free to negotiate
1232,and refuse proposals with which they did not
1233,"agree . The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles , because ,"
1234,"he said , they were out of date and vulnerable and"
1235,would attract enemy action .
1236,That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine .
1237,"So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons ,"
1238,"the West , somewhere , must have them too . It"
1239,was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
1240,purposes to be under the sea rather than on land .
1241,This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
1242,to oppose the Polaris depot ship .
1243,The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base
1244,"in the Holy Loch , only 30 miles from Glasgow , a"
1245,city with two million people . It should be sited
1246,in a more remote area . Mr. Gaitskell added that
1247,"the Scarborough conference decisions did not , in his"
1248,"view , truly reflect the opinions of the majority"
1249,of party members and still less the party's
1250,supporters in the country .
1251,Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the
1252,"unilateralists was not possible , though"
1253,he respected their views . He saw by reports
1254,"that "" those who organise these things "" were"
1255,recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear
1256,disarmament to shift the emphasis of
1257,their intervention away from straight opposition
1258,to the official document on to opposition
1259,to the Polaris base .
1260,"To Mr. Macmillan , Mr Gaitskell said the"
1261,Prime Minister should begin to take
1262,seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
1263,"weapons within the Nato alliance . "" Let us say"
1264,"to Macmillan that he should press , I hope"
1265,"with the agreement of Kennedy , in"
1266,"talks with the Soviet Union , for the establishment"
1267,in central Europe of a zone of controlled
1268,"disarmament . """
1269,"He thought , he said , that the Soviet"
1270,Union would be prepared to reach
1271,an agreement on a zone of controlled
1272,disarmament in Europe . Mr Gaitskell
1273,"concluded , declaring that the present"
1274,was the beginning of a great period of
1275,opportunity for the party . It was a
1276,great chance that should be grasped .
1277,Inter-union jealousies prevent the
1278,fulfilment of a common policy for wages
1279,"and other major questions , Mr. Jack Cooper"
1280,The General Council of the Trades Union
1281,Congress should therefore consider the
1282,matter . Consideration should also be given
1283,to the regrouping of unions and the
1284,modification of their structures to
1285,meet the growing concentration of
1286,capital . Mr. Cooper argued that a
1287,common industrial contribution was
1288,urgent - particularly in unions serving
1289,workers in the same industry - along
1290,Suggesting that a total T.U.C.
1291,"membership of eight million was a "" poor"
1292,"show "" compared with some countries , he"
1293,argued that the position needed examination .
1294,BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr.
1295,Macmillan yesterday morning he was given
1296,the views of a wide section of the
1297,British people about Polaris submarine
1298,bases in this country . An open letter
1299,written by Earl Russell hoping that the
1300,"Earl Russell , President of the Committee"
1301,"of 100 , told Kennedy that he should"
1302,"take notice of "" that very large and"
1303,growing section which is opposed to
1304,"the establishment of a Polaris base ,"
1305,whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on
1306,"British territory . "" He pointed out that"
1307,already there have been protests but
1308,"that "" very much larger protests are to"
1309,"be expected and are being planned . """
1310,There are three kinds of reasons that justify
1311,the protests and these should carry weight with
1312,"the U.S. Government , Earl Russell suggested . "" The"
1313,first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
1314,serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
1315,"U.S. and Great Britain , not only in Government"
1316,"circles , but in public opinion . "" Earl Russell"
1317,"says it is inevitable , though profoundly"
1318,"regrettable , that the agitation against"
1319,the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
1320,to the policy of the United States .
1321,The second reason is concerned with doubts
1322,as to the safety of the people of Great Britain ;
1323,""" in the time of crisis it would probably be"
1324,impossible for the British authorities to
1325,exercise any degree of control over the action
1326,"of Polaris submarines . "" He argues that"
1327,there is a distinct possibility that so long
1328,as there is a Polaris base in Britain the
1329,Soviet Union might retaliate against
1330,Britain alone .
1331,""" Such retaliation might , and probably would ,"
1332,destroy the whole population of Britain in
1333,"the course of , at the most , an hour "" without"
1334,provoking American retaliation . Earl Russell
1335,"believes : "" It is very questionable whether"
1336,British membership of Nato and British
1337,permission of American bases on our territory
1338,"add anything to the strength of America ,"
1339,"while , on the contrary , they impose upon"
1340,America an onerous obligation which it
1341,"may prove impossible to fulfil . """
1342,The third reason is that the supreme
1343,interest for the whole world - East and
1344,West and uncommitted nations - is the
1345,"prevention of nuclear war . "" A rapidly"
1346,growing body of opinion in this country
1347,believes that Britain could be more effective
1348,in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral
1349,by helping to suggest agreements which could
1350,"be accepted by both East and West . """
1351,"THE next White Paper on defence , to"
1352,"be published in March , is likely to"
1353,contain a five-year plan for the three
1354,Services . Its aim will be to produce superbly
1355,"equipped , all-Regular forces of"
1356,"about 400,000 men . The three Services"
1357,"would be "" integrated "" to a greater"
1358,extent than ever before .
1359,"Short of wearing the same uniform , which is"
1360,"not contemplated , the Navy , Army and Royal"
1361,"Air Force would become , for practical purposes ,"
1362,a single defence force . There would be
1363,complete co-operation at all levels in training
1364,and operations . This would apply also in the
1365,command structure and central administrative
1366,"organisation . Mr. Watkinson , Minister of Defence ,"
1367,"has been working on the plan for some months ,"
1368,with the Prime Minister's approval .
1369,He has had numerous meetings with the Service
1370,Ministers . He has also had talks with the Earl
1371,"of Home , Foreign Secretary , and with other"
1372,Ministers concerned with overseas aspects
1373,of defence policy . Details of the scheme
1374,are now being worked out by the Chiefs
1375,"of Staff , a process that may take four"
1376,or five months .
1377,The scheme will be subject to Cabinet
1378,approval . Mr. Watkinson remains con-
1379,vinced that the policy initiated in
1380,"1957 , in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister"
1381,"of Defence , is still correct . This was to"
1382,return to the tradition of all-Regular
1383,"voluntary forces , with the last National"
1384,Serviceman out of uniform by the end
1385,of 1962 .
1386,The Minister regards the recent trend
1387,of recruiting figures as encouraging .
1388,He is confident the aim can be achieved .
1389,While the possibility of an eventual return
1390,to National Service in some form
1391,"cannot be entirely discounted , he does"
1392,not agree that the point has been reached
1393,where this need even be considered . If
1394,"National Service is ever resorted to ,"
1395,engagement would probably have to be for
1396,three years .
1397,It is thought this would be the minimum
1398,necessary for the extended training modern
1399,arms require and to enable each man to
1400,serve at least a year overseas . There is
1401,no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson
1402,is at odds with the Service chiefs over
1403,the decision to dispense with National
1404,"Service , or over any other aspect of"
1405,defence policy .
1406,Criticisms about Army manpower appear
1407,to have come mainly from retired officers
1408,who have held high positions but
1409,are out of touch with the existing situation .
1410,Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support
1411,"from the C.I.G.S. , Field-Marshal Sir"
1412,"Francis Festing , who believes completely"
1413,in the principle of an all-Regular army .
1414,"Gen. Sir Richard Hull , who is to succeed"
1415,"Sir Francis , is equally convinced Mr."
1416,Watkinson is right .
1417,Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard
1418,"as from Nov. 1 . The hand-over , due in"
1419,"September , was delayed because of the"
1420,Berlin crisis . Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
1421,felt the change would be unwise at a
1422,moment # when attention had to be
1423,concentrated on possible need for important
1424,military operations . For this reason Sir
1425,"Francis stayed on , and # sacrificed"
1426,his leave .
1427,There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing
1428,"towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd ,"
1429,the Prime Minister . This implies the dis-
1430,appearance of the Progressive party from
1431,the House . Early results in yesterday's
1432,general election showed Nationalists being
1433,"returned in their strongholds , like Bloem-"
1434,"fontein and the Transvaal , with slightly"
1435,"increased majorities . In the Cape , the"
1436,"veteran United Party politician , Mr. Harry"
1437,"Lawrence , standing as a Progressive , was"
1438,The defeat of the leader of the
1439,"Progressive party , Dr. Steytler , in Port"
1440,"Elizabeth South , announced immediately"
1441,"afterwards by the United party candidate ,"
1442,"Mr. Plewman , left the Progressives deprived"
1443,of both their chief figures . Dr. Verwoerd and
1444,"the Leader of the Opposition , Sir de"
1445,"Villiers Graaff , have been returned unopposed ."
1446,The contests were for 86 seats as 70
1447,Nationalists and 20 United party candi-
1448,dates are unopposed .
1449,Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was
1450,evident that voters were bored by the
1451,Government's frequent appeals to the electorate .
1452,The election was the fourth in four years .
1453,In most constituencies it may go down as
1454,the most apathetic in the country's history .
1455,THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons
1456,last night that he had considered early
1457,in the Parliamentary recess whether to
1458,mobilise reserves necessary to bring the
1459,British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing .
1460,He decided that it would be a great error
1461,to do so and to recall Parliament . But
1462,there would be no hesitation in mobilising
1463,if a further deterioration in the situation
1464,warranted such a step . It would have to be
1465,"accompanied by other measures of a military ,"
1466,"economic and political kind . Mr. Macmillan ,"
1467,who was winding up the foreign affairs
1468,"debate , said the Government could not"
1469,be party to accepting as a matter of
1470,principle the imposed division of Germany .
1471,""" We must not be rattled into surrender ,"
1472,but we must not - and I am not - be
1473,"afraid of negotiation . "" Mr. Godber ,"
1474,"Minister of State , Foreign Office , said"
1475,earlier that the Government had asked
1476,the Medical Research Council to reassess
1477,the fall-out position in view of the Russian
1478,tests . The Council's findings would be
1479,made public .
1480,With a vigour and authority which delighted
1481,"old Parliamentary friends and foes alike ,"
1482,"the Earl of Avon , the former Sir Anthony"
1483,"Eden , in his maiden speech in the House"
1484,"of Lords last night , gave a warning"
1485,that # appeasement over Berlin could
1486,"only lead to war . To stand firm , he"
1487,"declared , was not to invite war , but"
1488,the surest way to avert it .
1489,It was the end of a rather curious
1490,speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up
1491,the two-day debate on foreign affairs .
1492,"He began in a low , almost chatty mono-"
1493,"tone , and his voice never rose to any"
1494,accent of urgency . He passed in rapid
1495,review the United Nations Secretariat ;
1496,nuclear tests ; the canard about British
1497,interference with the United Nations
1498,in the Congo ; Kuwait ; and South-East
1499,Asia .
1500,He spent most of his short half-hour on
1501,Berlin . He deplored the possibility of

1503,"by the Allies . "" We do not , "" he said , "" really"
1504,"know what the Russians want . "" But he was"
1505,certain that they wanted to establish a
1506,final and irrevocable division of Germany .
1507,Britain could not be a party to an imposed
1508,"division . But negotiation , as the debate had"
1509,"shown , could be undertaken on a variety"
1510,of bases .
1511,Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
1512,ately refrained during the summer from
1513,recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
1514,"by proclamation , such as would be"
1515,necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine
1516,on to a fully active footing . That
1517,would have created a thoroughly unde-
1518,sirable atmosphere of panic . He thought
1519,that the situation was rather more
1520,hopeful .
1521,The Russians now realised its seriousness . The
1522,French doubts were more about procedure
1523,than about substance . The Prime Minister's
1524,attitude of studied calm brought down the
1525,"temperature of the debate , which never"
1526,"at any time rose to fever pitch , to a"
1527,remarkable degree of sub-normality .
1528,Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl
1529,"of Home , Foreign Secretary , was listening"
1530,in the Peers' Gallery .
1531,The early speakers in the debate each
1532,severely rated the speech of his predecessor .
1533,These strictures were all too well justified .
1534,We started with the plaintive wailings
1535,"of Mr. Healey , "" Shadow "" Foreign Secretary ,"
1536,"described by Mr. Godber , Minister of"
1537,"State , Foreign Office , as "" pedantic and"
1538,"obscure on Berlin , damaging and obscure"
1539,"on the Congo . "" In turn , Mr. Godber was"
1540,"censured by Mr. Shinwell , former Labour"
1541,"Defence Minister , for having read the"
1542,The trouble about such debates is that
1543,they range too widely . They remind one of
1544,"the Rugby match in "" Tom Brown's Schooldays , """
1545,in which all the boys were welcome to
1546,"take part , and only those who "" really meant"
1547,"business "" removed their jackets . Not many"
1548,metaphorical braces were visible in the
1549,early stages of to-night's debate . Mr.
1550,Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's
1551,"golf-course Press conference , which he"
1552,"described as "" a display of flabby and"
1553,A reference to the reunification of Germany
1554,"brought a bark of "" Start another war ! """
1555,"from Mr. Ellis Smith ( Lab. , Stoke on Trent S. ) ."
1556,Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet
1557,theme of limitation of armaments in Europe .
1558,"This could , he suggested , be linked with"
1559,prohibition of the production of atomic
1560,weapons in any part of Europe . Inspection
1561,and control would be much easier to
1562,establish in these territories .
1563,Mr. Healey denounced the Government for
1564,using double standards . Ministers had
1565,rebuked the unaligned nations for not
1566,"condemning the new Russian tests , but"
1567,they themselves had no condemnation for
1568,events in Angola or Algeria . It was not for
1569,"the Government , said Mr. Healey , to"
1570,"take up moral attitudes , "" especially when"
1571,the temple of their religion is the
1572,"bingo-parlour . """
1573,This puzzled such students of comparative
1574,religion as had failed to detect this cult .
1575,But Mr. Healey had a partial and
1576,limited success . He rallied behind him
1577,the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last
1578,"night by his leader , Mr. Gaitskell . Mr."
1579,Godber's performance merited all the mild
1580,scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell .
1581,"True , he did tell the House that the"
1582,Government had asked the Medical Research
1583,Council to reassess the fall-out position in
1584,"view of the Russian tests , and said that"
1585,the council's findings would be published .
1586,He was not so happy in his defence of
1587,the Government's failure to condemn
1588,France for her nuclear tests in the
1589,Sahara on the grounds that they were
1590,only little ones .
1591,This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid
1592,and her illegitimate baby . For the most
1593,"part , Mr. Godber muttered his way"
1594,through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office
1595,"brief . He resembles the elephant seal , an"
1596,# otherwise endearing creature whose
1597,"articulation is limited , we are told , to a"
1598,series of heavy sighs . Sir Lynn Ungoed-

1619,MR SELWYN LLOYD may speed up his plans
1620,to catch speculators in shares and property .
1621,The first hint of the Chancellor bowing to
1622,"public opinion over his "" July Budget "" came"
1623,dramatically in the Commons yesterday . Mr
1624,Lloyd said on # Tuesday that he proposed
1625,to deal in his next regular Budget with
1626,some profits which now escape tax .
1627,"Sir Edward Boyle , Financial Secretary"
1628,"to the Treasury , said yesterday that the"
1629,Government does not like retrospective legislation .
1630,He went on to describe the kind of
1631,people the Chancellor hopes to tax . These
1632,are people buying and selling shares within
1633,"a short period , those "" stagging "" on a new issue"
1634,and property dealers who form a chain of
1635,companies and put one property deal through
1636,each .
1637,"Mr. Harold Wilson , Shadow Chancellor , jumped up to"
1638,offer the Government an easy passage for such
1639,"legislation . "" Why don't you make proposals to legislate"
1640,"in the autumn ? "" Mr. Wilson asked . "" We wouldn't call"
1641,it an Autumn Budget . You can call it a Taxation
1642,"Management Bill , if you like . "" While Mr. Wilson"
1643,"was speaking , the Prime Minister and Mr. Lloyd"
1644,had a whispered conversation .
1645,They nodded at each other and Sir Edward
1646,rose to say that the Chancellor would bear
1647,Mr. Wilson's offer in mind . Guy Eden writes :
1648,Treasury experts are already working on
1649,the scheme . Profits of genuine investors
1650,"in industry will not be affected , but only"
1651,quick in-and-out speculator deals .
1652,"FRANK FOULKES , Communist president"
1653,"of the ETU , refused yesterday to"

1655,invitation .
1656,He was announcing his executive's rejection of the ultimatum to the
1657,"ETU. In reply to the call for his resignation he said : "" Our rules"
1658,say that if an official resigns he is not allowed to run again
1659,"for three years . "" I have only 2 1/2 years to go before I retire ,"
1660,so this is an invitation from my good friends of the TUC that
1661,I should commit hara-kiri .
1662,The other TUC demands : Five leading
1663,Communists must not hold office for five
1664,years ; Sub-committees set up to strip
1665,secretary John Byrne of his powers must
1666,disband in ten days . These the ETU
1667,"executive rejected as "" wholly unacceptable """
1668,"and "" unwarranted "" interference . "" But it"
1669,agreed to postpone operation of the sub-

1693,"concluded : "" The best service the Prime Minister can do"
1694,"would be to resign . "" The outburst shocked MPs of"
1695,all parties . Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell
1696,to stop .
1697,"There were loud cries of "" shame "" from"
1698,all parts of the Conservative side . Mr.
1699,Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat
1700,"down . A few minutes later , Mr. Fell got up"
1701,and left the chamber . He returned five
1702,minutes later to stand just inside the
1703,doorway looking more composed . In the
1704,"middle of the amazing scene , Mr. Macmillan"
1705,waved his hand at Mr. Fell .
1706,"This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more . "" I cannot be told"
1707,"to sit down by the Prime Minister . "" Protests had been expected"
1708,from Tory rebels . But Mr. Fell's attack was unprecedented . He
1709,"accused the Prime Minister of "" political double talk . "" "" It had"
1710,the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime
1711,"Minister is a national disaster , "" he said ."
1712,"Most MPs agreed that Mr. Fell's attack had , if"
1713,"anything , rallied support to the Prime Minister ."
1714,"This apparently , was Mr. Macmillan's assessment ."
1715,He confined his reply to the observation
1716,"that Mr. Fell had probably "" maximised his"
1717,"support . "" There were no other attacks"
1718,of such ferocity . But there was ample
1719,evidence of Conservative and Labour
1720,"opposition , which will be aired in the"
1721,debate tomorrow and on Thursday .
1722,"As Mr. Macmillan made his announcement , the"
1723,"House was crowded . He said : "" No # British"
1724,Government could join the European Economic
1725,Community without prior negotiation with a view

1727,of our European Free Trade Association partners
1728,"and of British agriculture . "" Near the end of a"

1732,Majesty's Government have come to the
1733,conclusion that it would be right for

1736,"the Community . "" At this point , Mr. Paul"
1737,"Williams ( Cons. , Sunderland ) called out"
1738,""" Shame . "" Mr. Williams is a close"
1739,associate of Mr. Fell .
1740,"He claimed that , unless we were in the"
1741,"Common Market , we should not be able to"
1742,play any part in # determining its future .
1743,""" We can lead better from within , "" he said ."
1744,Mr. Macmillan dealt with the main objection
1745,"raised by Tory critics . Mr. Anthony Fell ,"
1746,who created a scene on this point on
1747,"Monday , took up a position almost hidden"
1748,behind the Serjeant at Arms' chair .
1749,Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help
1750,to the Commonwealth through the
1751,strength we would gain in the Common
1752,Market than by isolation . He paid
1753,tribute to the development of the
1754,"Common Market . "" The Community"
1755,( Common Market ) has imparted an
1756,impetus and an economic growth
1757,"to The Six . Above all , it is an idea"
1758,"which has gripped men's minds , """
1759,he said .
1760,"Referring to previous negotiations , Mr. Macmillan looked towards"
1761,"Mr. Reginald Maudling . "" These were negotiations in which the"
1762,"President of the Board of Trade played a conspicuous part , "" the"
1763,Premier said . He dismissed the idea that Britain would be

1765,"probably gain . "" Many people feel we have had , perhaps , too"
1766,"much shelter , "" he went on ."
1767,Conservatives protested when

1780,BUDGETTE or no Budgette YOU are

1783,On the eve of August Bank Holiday
1784,the spending spree is at a new
1785,all-time peak .
1786,Note circulation soared for the
1787,sixth successive week - this
1788,"time by more than 15,000,000 # last"
1789,week . And that brought the figure
1790,"to a record 2,415,000,000 . This was"
1791,"100,000,000 more than the corresponding"
1792,"week last year and 37,000,000 up on"

1794,Now look at the other side of all

1796,"The big "" squeeze "" means that it is going to be more"
1797,difficult to arrange a loan or overdraft . And banks will be
1798,stricter in recalling existing overdrafts . This is underlined in
1799,the Central Bank's weekly return ... ... which shows that more
1800,"than 163,000,000 of the banks' money is now frozen in the"
1801,form of special deposits with the Bank of England .

1808,MR. KRUSCHEV raises the bogy of
1809,German militarism in his replies to
1810,the West on Berlin . And he repeats
1811,"that the problem "" must be solved"
1812,"this year . """
1813,The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to
1814,West Germany were published in Moscow yesterday . They
1815,tell : The U.S. - It is false to say the absence of a peace
1816,"treaty with Germany causes no real danger . West Germany ,"
1817,"with its militarists and revenge-seekers , is becoming a"
1818,"hotbed of war danger in Europe . Even now , aided by"
1819,"the U.S. , Britain and France , it has more than enough"
1820,forces and arms to touch off a world war .
1821,BRITAIN - One cannot but wonder at British bases being
1822,put at the disposal of those very militarists who razed
1823,Coventry and barbarously bombed London and other British
1824,cities . FRANCE - One can hardly conceive the French are
1825,"not alarmed ... . Next door , in West Germany , before everyone's"
1826,eyes there has sprung up a regular army led by former Nazi
1827,generals and officers .
1828,With fire and sword France denies Algeria the right to self-
1829,determination and tramples on Tunisians' right to independence .
1830,WEST GERMANY - Russia would like to see a clear #
1831,realization that West Germany would not survive even a few hours
1832,of a third world war . The best way to rule out such a tragic
1833,contingency would be to sign a peace treaty to remove the cancerous
1834,growth of West Berlin's occupation status .
1835,Behind Bonn's slogan of German self-
1836,determination is the intention to impose
1837,on East Germany the regime existing in
1838,West Germany . REFUGEES are pouring out
1839,# of East Germany into West
1840,Berlin faster than ever . Mr. K's latest
1841,"speech scared 1,157 East Germans to"
1842,cross into West Berlin's reception centre
1843,DURING MONDAY NIGHT . And officials
1844,expect the total to leap to
1845,"3,000 a day ."
1846,This figure has been surpassed only on the eve of the
1847,"East German disturbances on July 17 , 1953 . And officials"
1848,fear it may be too much for the city's refugee camps .
1849,They will overflow and private houses will have to be used .
1850,Prime Minister after Prime Minister speaks out
1851,in revulsion against the South African
1852,Government's policy of apartheid as we wait
1853,for the curtain to rise on the Commonwealth
1854,Conference in London . Will it end with
1855,South Africa's exclusion from the
1856,Commonwealth ? The issue is touch and go .
1857,There is a possibility that it will not be
1858,settled at this conference . It may be agreed to
1859,wait until South Africa actually becomes a
1860,Republic later in the year . But if a final
1861,"decision is to be faced now , on which side"
1862,do the strongest arguments lie ? THE Archbishop
1863,of Capetown has shown that the matter is
1864,not clear-cut .
1865,The Archbishop has long been a courageous
1866,fighter against apartheid . He must be heard
1867,with attention . On purely practical grounds he
1868,holds that it would be a mistake to expel
1869,"South Africa , weakening the whites who are"
1870,working for a change of policy . In his view
1871,it would also be against the interests of the
1872,Africans .
1873,He holds that more pressure can be put on South
1874,Africa while she remains in the Commonwealth
1875,than could be exercised were she cut off from it .
1876,"On the other hand , those who favour expulsion , inclu-"
1877,"ding African leaders , feel that nothing less than the"
1878,shock of expulsion will weaken the grip of Dr.
1879,Verwoerd and the Nationalists . They point out
1880,that Dr. Verwoerd refuses to consider abandoning
1881,the apartheid policy .
1882,THE Commonwealth is a multi-racial society . A
1883,policy of racial discrimination in any of its countries
1884,is surely the one thing that it could not survive .
1885,Whatever statesmen say at the conference table in
1886,"London , millions at home would regard as fraudulent"
1887,a Commonwealth which had room for a racist
1888,South Africa . And this is a Commonwealth in
1889,which five citizens are coloured for every one
1890,who is white .
1891,"Seen in this wider picture , a South Africa that clings to"
1892,apartheid is a menace to the Commonwealth and a
1893,liability to the whole Western world . A practical
1894,solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft
1895,a set of principles excluding race discrimination .
1896,"And so leave South Africa to make the grade ,"
1897,or go out .
1898,THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home
1899,tonight from their tour in the East . The duke's
1900,trigger-finger and the ritual slaughter of beasts
1901,have taken the headlines in this country .
1902,"Nevertheless , the tour has been an immense"
1903,success . The Queen has won a triumph . It
1904,would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal
1905,performances as tiger and rhino hunts were
1906,dropped from future Royal programmes .
1907,But the Queen and the Duke have pleased millions by
1908,their visit . The warmth of their welcome in India and
1909,Pakistan are happy memories . WEST GERMANY - followed
1910,yesterday by the Dutch - has made the gesture
1911,of a good neighbour . She has put up the value
1912,of her money .
1913,"Certainly , the rise is very small . But it is a step"
1914,in the direction of live-and-let-live . Hopes
1915,will now grow brighter of further international
1916,"co-operation , which is the only way to solve the"
1917,payments difficulties that upset the Western world .
1918,"Britain and the U.S. , which have problems with"
1919,"their balances , will gain some immediate help ."
1920,What it means in practical terms is that our
1921,exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper
1922,"for Germans to buy , while the goods which"
1923,Germany exports will be made a little dearer .
1924,Booming Germany is deliberately encouraging more imports
1925,as a means to curb rising prices at home . She is
1926,also aware how # unpopular she has been growing
1927,by failing until now to co-operate as a creditor nation
1928,should . Germany exports much more than she imports .
1929,For upwards of five years the world's reserves of
1930,dollars have been drained into Germany .
1931,There they have stayed uselessly locked up because
1932,Germany has no tradition of trading abroad . In addition
1933,the strength of Germany's trading position has attracted
1934,"speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars ,"
1935,"hoping for the mark to rise , as has now happened ."
1936,WILL the new valuation be enough to correct
1937,Germany's massive trading surplus and choke
1938,off speculation against dollar and pound ?
1939,"That is doubtful . If however , in addition to her new"
1940,"good-neighbour gesture , Germany takes a really big"
1941,"share in giving aid to underdeveloped nations , the"
1942,world outlook will be brighter . What gives rise
1943,to optimism is the sign that Germany and the
1944,other leading Western nations are at long last
1945,moving towards a solution of currency problems
1946,by co-operation .
1947,"A CURIOUS advertisement on page nine , paid"

1949,Those who lend their names to this kind of

1952,idea that moral regeneration would solve
1953,all our problems . So it would . While we are

1956,"instruments of democracy , such as trade unions"
1957,and our local and national Parliaments .
1958,Should the Herald publish such advertisements ?
1959,This is a difficult question . It would obviously
1960,be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with
1961,which we disagree . When an advertisement
1962,contains statements whose factual truth is
1963,"doubtful , or where the total content would be"
1964,"deeply repugnant to our readers , it is right to"
1965,exercise editorial discretion . The MRA
1966,"advertisement falls into neither category , though"
1967,many readers will dislike it .
1968,The first reaction of the Sudanese
1969,Government was to denounce the United
1970,"Nations for "" negligence and impotence , "" and"
1971,to say that its 400 troops in the Congo
1972,would be taken home . The reaction can be
1973,understood . The Sudan's concern for its
1974,men is natural . But this could hardly be
1975,a # dignified exit . IF the UN is
1976,"blamed for being weak , it would be"
1977,"more logical to send in more men ,"
1978,not weaken it further by desertion .
1979,It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr.
1980,Hammarskjold and the UN's servants . The
1981,responsibility rightly belongs to the nations
1982,which have undertaken the task of pre-
1983,serving peace in the Congo . That is not a
1984,"ceremonial duty , and the soldiers have every"
1985,right to blame the politicians unless they see
1986,it through . When the United Nations instructed
1987,Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to
1988,"prevent civil war , it was clear that new dangers"
1989,would arise unless it gave him the political ...
1990,That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold
1991,made . India has responded handsomely by providing
1992,"3,000 men , who must take about a fortnight to arrive ."
1993,"If the UN forces were thick enough on the ground ,"
1994,such incidents as that at Matadi would not
1995,happen . THE UN's ability to keep peace depends
1996,simply on adequate support by the nations
1997,which have set their hands to this plough .
1998,The big Powers involved in the Cold War
1999,must of course keep out . The Americans were
2000,justified in diverting naval ships in case
2001,non-combatant help was wanted ; but they
2002,stressed that there was no intention to intervene
2003,in fighting . Yesterday the ships turned away
2004,"again , satisfied that they were not required ."
2005,It is to be hoped that the UN will be
2006,re-established in their port by negotiation
2007,and that there will be no more outrages .
2008,"But back , Mr. Hammarskjold is determined ,"
2009,they must go . The best news for the Congo
2010,would be agreement between its rival
2011,political leaders . Through the patient efforts
2012,of UN conciliators they are meeting for
2013,"the first time , in Malagasy ( formerly"
2014,Madagascar ) . THE world will sigh with
2015,relief when this strife-torn land gets
2016,itself a government which all outsiders
2017,can recognise .
2018,ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he regards
2019,"as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as "" a"
2020,"policy of good neighbourliness . "" We may be sure that"
2021,he is not being hypocritical . That is what he
2022,really believes . A good neighbour to those Africans
2023,"who , under apartheid , will be forced back to"
2024,their tribal reserves with no prospect but a
2025,cramped and primitive existence .
2026,A good neighbour to those Africans who will con-
2027,tinue to live as hewers of wood and drawers of
2028,"water in the white areas of South Africa , without rights"
2029,and without hope . THE same sort of good neighbour
2030,that he proved to be to the Jews fleeing from
2031,Hitler in the thirties . It was Dr. Verwoerd who
2032,led a protest against admitting any of them
2033,"because they would "" defile "" the national"
2034,white stock .
2035,It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver-
2036,woerd in his nightmare world . It is this that
2037,makes illusory any hopes that he may be in-
2038,fluenced to change course . The Archbishop of
2039,"Capetown , Dr. Joost de Blank , has pleaded that"
2040,South Africa should be allowed to stay in the
2041,"Commonwealth . Otherwise , he says , those inside the"
2042,country who still oppose apartheid will be
2043,left even more isolated and alone .
2044,"The views of the Archbishop , who has"
2045,maintained an unflinching witness to what
2046,"Christianity really means , must carry weight . But"
2047,"what , in fact , can the other Commonwealth countries"
2048,do to bring support and comfort to this gallant
2049,minority ? THERE is no evidence that the
2050,policy of appeasement has modified the
2051,"actions of the Nationalists . On the contrary ,"
2052,apartheid is being applied ever more
2053,ruthlessly .
2054,The shock of expulsion from the
2055,Commonwealth now seems to be the only
2056,way left to try to bring home to the people of
2057,South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd is leading them
2058,to disaster . It may be that the Commonwealth
2059,Prime Ministers will decide against this final
2060,step . If that is their decision they should also
2061,go unequivocally on record that they regard
2062,apartheid as evil and indefensible .
2063,"Unless they do at least that , Dr. Verwoerd will"
2064,be able to return home claiming a triumph .
2065,His smile will be blander than ever . WE are in
2066,for it again : another Royal Wedding . Between
2067,"now and June , when the Duke of Kent will"
2068,"marry Miss Worsley , hardly a day will pass"
2069,"without a story or a picture or probably both ,"
2070,about the nuptial arrangements .
2071,What seems certain is that those who
2072,advocate putting off any approach until
2073,Mr Krushchev gives evidence of a change
2074,of heart ( whatever that may mean ) would
2075,have us run risks greater than the West
2076,ought to run - and greater than President
2077,Kennedy's most influential advisers seem
2078,disposed to face . The real question is
2079,what we should put to the Soviet
2080,Government as a basis for talks : and
2081,On this reading what Mr. Gollancz calls
2082,"manoeuvring , and what we should call"
2083,"cool-headed and inventive negotiation , is"
2084,a means not to destruction but to safety .
2085,The Government's pompous little statement
2086,"on Northern Rhodesia does not say much ,"
2087,but it says what is necessary - that
2088,the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is
2089,"open to revision . This is news , however"
2090,much the Government tries to disguise
2091,it by saying that the revision would be
2092,"Formula One , which appeared in February , appeared to make"
2093,"this likely ; Formula Two , which appeared in June , made it"
2094,very unlikely ; if Formula Three restores the original
2095,"principle , that is all that need be required of it . It is a pity"
2096,that the Government should ever have been led away
2097,from this principle . It is a great pity that the
2098,"Government should give the appearance of responding , not"
2099,"to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations , but to"
2100,the violence which he tried to prevent .
2101,"To be able to say "" New York next week "" is an"
2102,important advance . We must not be overconfident
2103,that this # meeting will lead on to further
2104,"and decisive ones ; but without it , we could not"
2105,look for them . Federal Germany votes tomorrow
2106,and not a day too soon . There can seldom have
2107,been an election campaign which more people
2108,in and out of the country wanted to see over
2109,and done with .
2110,To Germany's Western allies the campaign has been a
2111,millstone weighing down and almost paralysing their
2112,efforts to work out sensible ways of dealing with
2113,the Berlin crisis . It need not have been such a burden
2114,if Western Governments had not been convinced
2115,that they must do nothing to harm even remotely Dr
2116,Adenauer's chances of being returned as Chancellor .
2117,But they were so convinced and they
2118,have had to take the consequences . Mean-
2119,while in Germany itself the course of
2120,the campaign has dismayed a good
2121,many people : they too will be glad
2122,when the polling stations close .
2123,But discussion on current points of east-west con-
2124,"flict could not go much farther than , for example , the"
2125,truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament
2126,cannot be followed together . What the council has done -
2127,and it is an achievement - is to make religious con-
2128,tact across the greatest political barrier in what
2129,is not yet a unitary world .
2130,The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the
2131,agreement is signed . To this there will be some opposition . The Bill is
2132,"short and modest in scope , and it is doubtful whether the other Private"
2133,Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps . This fact may give
2134,the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the
2135,next report from the Molony committee .
2136,"Comprehensive legislation is obviously preferable . They should not ,"
2137,"however , disdain this opportunity of obtaining a useful sample of"
2138,parliamentary opinion by at least allowing these Bills a fair run .
2139,Centigrade v. Fahrenheit . The fight is on . The challenger has behind
2140,it not only the authority of the SECRETARY of STATE for AIR
2141,but also the backing of the DIRECTOR GENERAL of the Meteoro-
2142,logical Office .
2143,The press and the broadcasting authorities are
2144,"asked to help . To begin with , both tempe-"
2145,ratures will be put in the ring together .
2146,"SIR GRAHAM SUTTON , however , made no bones"
2147,about it yesterday . The purpose is to give
2148,fahrenheit the knock out . The backers of
2149,centigrade would have got off to a better
2150,start if they had taken more pains to
2151,explain the advantages to the general
2152,public of the change .
2153,It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is
2154,"at the moment "" an awful mess up "" in"
2155,"the measurement of temperatures . This ,"
2156,"however , seems a matter of the convenience"
2157,of specialists . The ordinary British man
2158,and woman is conscious of no difficulty .
2159,Rather than fifty million people having
2160,"to be put out for the sake of 50,000 is there"
2161,any reason why the centigrade countries
2162,should not change to fahrenheit ?
2163,Can it be shown that the one scale is demon-
2164,strably better than the other ? The centigraders may
2165,be in for a stiffer fight than they think . They may
2166,have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market .
2167,Even then it might be easier to persuade the British
2168,public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain
2169,circumstances the time would come when this would
2170,suit their convenience - rather than to change their
2171,system of recording temperatures .
2172,"In any case , fahrenheit need not lose heart ."
2173,"Once before , and that not so long ago , the"
2174,authorities ganged up to alter the habits
2175,of the people . That effort was to enforce
2176,the adoption of the twenty-four hour
2177,"clock . Then , also , the B.B.C. were"
2178,roped in . The only result was
2179,that the well-meaning corporation
2180,became very unpopular .
2181,A BAFFLED and bewildered little country
2182,stands at the centre of an international
2183,storm . Belgium is accused - without a
2184,scrap of evidence - of being implicated in
2185,the murder of Patrice Lumumba . Her
2186,"leaders are insulted , her embassies are"
2187,attacked in a score of countries .
2188,"In Ghana , President Nkrumah , who"
2189,has done more than most to stir up
2190,"trouble in the Congo , orders every Belgian"
2191,citizen to quit his country . HOUNDING
2192,Belgium has become an international
2193,pastime . Why ? Because those who
2194,said the Congolese could govern themselves
2195,will not admit they were wrong . So
2196,"Belgium , bowed down by internal"
2197,"troubles , mourning a terrible air crash ,"
2198,is made their scapegoat .
2199,Who will speak for Belgium ? Who else but
2200,Britain . We have fought beside Belgium
2201,in two world wars . We are allies still .
2202,Britain should champion Belgium . Not
2203,"with the careful , hooded language of diplomacy ,"
2204,but boldly and fearlessly . It is time to
2205,show the world that this country does not
2206,"desert her friends . HAPPY , happy"
2207,families ! Never before have Britain's
2208,larders been so well stocked .
2209,Supplies of meat and dairy produce were
2210,substantially higher last year than in 1959 .
2211,"Lucky , lucky housewives ! To have such a"
2212,splendid variety of goods to choose from .
2213,Not so long ago older folk were reminding
2214,"young wives , # harassed by"
2215,"shortages , of the good old days of"
2216,abundance . Now it is mother who
2217,picks up recipes from # her daughter .
2218,The dinner table is the best answer to the grumblers in
2219,"Britain today ! "" THIS is colour day , "" proclaimed the American"
2220,"television network , N.B.C. And hour after hour it poured out its"
2221,programmes in bright colours . In America colour TV is five years
2222,"old . There are already 600,000 sets in use . What about Britain ?"
2223,"The B.B.C. is ready to launch a colour TV service , but the"
2224,commercial TV contractors want to delay it for 10 years .
2225,The Government should settle this argument with two words to
2226,the B.B.C. : - Go ahead ! ONE man beyond all others is saddened
2227,by the deaths of two elderly sisters who killed themselves because
2228,"they had to leave their cottage . Mr. John Crabb , clerk to"
2229,"Newmarket urban council , says : "" I shall always feel this as a"
2230,"personal failure . """
2231,There is no reason whatsoever why he should reproach himself . The
2232,sisters had to quit as their home was falling down . And Mr. Crabb
2233,"did his best for them , even driving them to a new house . John"
2234,Crabb has the qualities of sympathy and understanding . Too
2235,often lacking in officialdom . MR. HENRY NEWTON of Acton
2236,does not want his daughter to marry a Scotsman .
2237,He says that the Scots are foreigners who have no business to
2238,be in England . The first ruler of the United Kingdom was a
2239,Scot . The Lord Chancellor is a Scot . The Prime Minister is a
2240,Scot - and so were four of his predecessors this # century .
2241,Let Mr. Newton beware . By protesting against Scotland he
2242,may be guilty of rebellion !
2243,ARCHBISHOP MAKARIOS puts the Commonwealth on trial .
2244,His ex-Eoka Government decides that Cyprus will join it for
2245,five years . During this period Britain will be expected
2246,to subsidise and defend the Cypriots . They will enjoy
2247,all the trading benefits of Imperial Preference . It is a
2248,safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and
2249,company will sign on again .
2250,It is equally certain that the British Government
2251,"will welcome them . How splendid it would be if , just"
2252,"for once , the Government were to voice the real feelings of"
2253,the British people . And tell Makarios they are not
2254,prepared to accept him on such terms . GOOD cheer
2255,"for the week-end . Ford Motors are to put 13,000"
2256,men back on a five-day week .
2257,One more demonstration of the industry's recovery . As
2258,"springtime approaches , orders pick up . And the car men get"
2259,ready for another bustling season . The pessimists
2260,said the motor industry was on its knees . The optimists
2261,"said "" Nonsense . "" As usual , the optimists have been"
2262,proved right . EARL RUSSELL and his friends have
2263,hit on an original way of spending this afternoon .
2264,They intend to sit outside the Ministry of Defence . It is
2265,their protest against the H-bomb . They ought to have a
2266,"pleasant time . The weather forecast is good ; except for them ,"
2267,Whitehall should be deserted . And they will have a fine view
2268,"of St. James's Park , with its placid lake , pelicans ,"
2269,"rare ducks , and other wild life ."
2270,Why not follow Lord Russell's lead today ?
2271,Head for the parks to enjoy the sun . Not in
2272,"a foolish cause , but in a glorious one . Good health !"
2273,"THIS group of men , says a report , work on average"
2274,between 55 and 60 hours a week . They also put
2275,in an extra two or three evenings . And they never
2276,go on strike .
2277,Who are they ? The trade union officials of Britain .
2278,Men who earn only a fraction of what their
2279,talents and responsibilities could bring in the open
2280,labour market . The unions are fortunate indeed to
2281,find dedicated leaders at cut-rate prices . But it is
2282,time the members decided to pay up and be good
2283,employers . THE Labour Party says that the Tory
2284,Government is destroying the social services .
2285,Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the
2286,national income was spent on social services . The
2287,present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many
2288,worthwhile targets for the Opposition . What a pity
2289,"to aim at the wrong one ! MRS. MARCIA POWER ,"
2290,"whose husband made her clean his uniform , wins"
2291,a divorce . The judge says she had to act almost
2292,as a serf .
2293,Up and down the country husbands will be saying
2294,they would never behave like that . But do they ever
2295,ponder how their gardening tools are mysteriously
2296,"returned to the shed ; their books tidied ; and often ,"
2297,even their shoes cleaned ? How wonderful if they
2298,showed their appreciation this morning with a surprise
2299,box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers !
2300,HOW the Government must repent its haste and folly
2301,in Rhodesia ! Eighteen months ago this territory
2302,"was peaceful , orderly , and thriving . Africans within the"
2303,Federal Government were getting valuable experience in
2304,administration . Then Mr. Iain Macleod became Colonial
2305,Secretary . Suddenly everything changed . Timetables were
2306,scrapped . The ill-conceived Monckton Commission was
2307,"rushed out to Rhodesia . Overnight , minor African"
2308,politicians were inflated into international figures .
2309,And as the British Government stepped up the pace
2310,"of change , so the Africans stepped up their demands ."
2311,"TODAY , in London , that rash and thoughtless policy has"
2312,caused a crisis - a crisis that never should have happened .
2313,No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching .
2314,If the Government now reverses its plan to give the
2315,Africans control in Northern Rhodesia it may indeed face
2316,difficulties from African politicians greedy for power .
2317,But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well
2318,"be plunged into chaos , like the Congo . For Mr."
2319,Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice . They
2320,must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos . And try to
2321,repair the damage they have done . WHO can grow the
2322,fastest ? That is the exciting competition going on
2323,among Britain's major industries .
2324,"Top of the table , at the moment , is the chemical industry ."
2325,"Then comes engineering , followed by iron and steel ."
2326,Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the
2327,tremendous upsurge in investment . It reports that new
2328,factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
2329,up on 1960 . Britain's business men are right to back
2330,their faith with cash .
2331,For expansion today means still greater
2332,"prosperity tomorrow . BERTRAND RUSSELL ,"
2333,the 88-year-old standard bearer of the Ban-
2334,"the-Bomb crusade , has devoted following ."
2335,Thousands march with him - and sit with him
2336,too . It is said by some that he is a saint ; by
2337,"others that he is a prophet . He is , in fact , a"
2338,philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity
2339,who has been spectacularly wrong on the great
2340,issues of our time .
2341,BEFORE the war he urged the British people
2342,to welcome Hitler's troops as tourists .
2343,After the war he favoured a preventive war against
2344,Russia . Now he wants Britain to demolish her
2345,defences . Throughout the years Lord Russell
2346,and his supporters have been able to pursue their
2347,eccentric campaigns in freedom . They should
2348,ask themselves this question : How long would
2349,that freedom last if their policies were adopted ?
2350,AN experiment in courtesy is launched by the Electricity
2351,Board . The board is laying a cable along a seven-
2352,"mile route in Surrey . A warden , Mr. Jack Finlay ,"
2353,has been appointed to smooth out difficulties for
2354,householders when trenches are dug outside their
2355,front gates . Splendid . By showing concern
2356,for the people the board will earn their good will .
2357,"Happy patrolling , Mr. Finlay !"
2358,"GOOD for Sir Roy Welensky ! The tough ,"
2359,resolute Premier of the Rhodesian Federation
2360,shakes the life out of his critics . He calls them
2361,""" jelly-boned . "" He promises to preserve federation"
2362,against African fanatics and woolly minded
2363,individuals in the West . Some may ask : Is
2364,Welensky justified in being so harsh to those who
2365,disagree with him ? The facts answer that .
2366,"CONTRAST his firm , successful rule in Rhodesia"
2367,with what has happened in the Congo . There
2368,Welensky's opponents have carried their theories
2369,"into practice . There a UNO army of Africans ,"
2370,"bossed by an Indian , has been in charge for"
2371,months . And what has it made of the Congo ?
2372,A bloodstained shambles . No wonder
2373,Welensky has lost all patience with his
2374,misguided tormentors .
2375,They have earned his strictures . And his
2376,contempt . SOME people are for ever complaining
2377,that teenagers earn too much and spend it all
2378,when they get it . Now a survey of the Post
2379,Office Savings Bank shows how wrong that
2380,idea is . The biggest group of depositors in
2381,the bank is made of boys and girls aged 15
2382,to 19 .
2383,Certainly teenagers earn more than ever before .
2384,Certainly they spend more . But how splendid
2385,that in the most prosperous days in this
2386,country's history the old-fashioned virtue of thrift
2387,should still have a powerful appeal for young
2388,people . THE Danes are annoyed with British
2389,farmers for fighting against Danish competition .
2390,They say that our farmers do not seem to
2391,understand the meaning of free trade .
2392,There is no doubt what the Danes understand
2393,by free trade . It is that they should be free
2394,"to sell as much as they like , while buying"
2395,more and more from our rivals . Germany has
2396,now supplanted Britain as Denmark's
2397,principal supplier . The farmers of Britain
2398,understand free trade . That is why they fight
2399,it .
2400,"THE Palace cinema at Buckley , near Chester , will be"
2401,reopened next week by Barry Flanagan and Eric
2402,"Platt , both aged 19 . Eric says : "" We believe in the"
2403,"cinema . And we know what people want . "" The"
2404,combination of enthusiasm and shrewd anticipation
2405,of public taste has launched many great
2406,enterprises . Barry and Eric have enthusiasm . They
2407,are backed by a resurgent film industry .
2408,It could be curtain up on two success stories . Of
2409,the old Palace . And Barry and Eric . DONS at
2410,Cambridge want the study of agriculture to become
2411,an honours degree course . Farming is Britain's
2412,most vital industry . It is increasingly dependent
2413,on new techniques - and on the universities to
2414,provide men of knowledge and skill .
2415,The older universities are often accused of being
2416,interested only in dead subjects . Now Cambridge has
2417,the opportunity to show is just as interested in the
2418,"living . Particularly as its rival , Oxford , has had a"
2419,similar course in farming for 15 years !
2420,"JOHN GLENN , Virgil Grissom , Alan Shepard . One of"
2421,these three men has a date with destiny - the
2422,first journey into Space .
2423,At the beginning of this wonderful century many
2424,people believed that there were no more worlds to
2425,conquer .
2426,"Nobody 's going to shove 2ole Uncle Sam around ! "" He then"
2427,"took out a piece of paper , wrote his address on it and added :"
2428,""" Anybody mucking the Yanks about had better call on me"
2429,"first . I won't stand for it . "" Exit a puzzled American ."
2430,The other incident occurred in the boat-train from Cherbourg
2431,to Paris .
2432,The travellers from the New World who had
2433,"been in Britain many times before , were"
2434,"slightly stunned . Afterwards they said : "" We thought"
2435,"we knew it all , but you Britishers never run"
2436,"out of unturned stones . """
2437,"To the British Travel Association , doing their excellent"
2438,"darndest , I offer these sad complexities . IN the 1830's"
2439,the Luddites took sledge-hammers to their looms and
2440,"many a good trade unionist since then has , in the"
2441,"hope of improving the lot of his fellow workers , taken"
2442,the theoretical Luddite hammer again .
2443,Hence the hostility to automation and
2444,the stop-watch manufacturing methods that
2445,have # led to restrictive practices . Now a new
2446,threat to those who toil and spin has been
2447,developed by a firm specialising in electronics
2448,in Los Angeles . They have developed a new
2449,system whereby completely untrained workers
2450,can be taught their trade by means of tape
2451,recordings and television .
2452,What happens is that the unskilled worker
2453,"is processed , by high-speed listening to recorded"
2454,instructions on how to do the job coupled with
2455,"explanatory TV pictures , into becoming a highly"
2456,"skilled , obedient craftsman in no time at all ."
2457,Not only can the raw human mind be
2458,technically equipped very quickly to do one
2459,set of skilled manufacturing processes in one
2460,"trade but , by being given another of the new"
2461,"audio-TV training techniques , he can be switched"
2462,to a different industry if he just gives in and
2463,From being an assembler in an aircraft
2464,factory to becoming a paint sprayer in
2465,"a ceramic factory , he can be qualified"
2466,for a completely new job in less time

2468,"Martyrs ! "" "" CRICKET , "" says the Oxford"
2469,"Dictionary , is "" an open air game played"
2470,"with ball , bats and wickets between"

2473,You are out of date . Cricket in 1961 is played
2474,"with a theodolite , six surveyors , a ball ;"
2475,bats and wickets between two sides . Shades
2476,of the village stalwarts of Hambledon who
2477,are now the patron saints of the game !
2478,What would THEY have thought of
2479,these civil engineers creeping about
2480,the pitch with their optical
2481,instruments ?
2482,The village green is the real home of cricket . A couple of bumps
2483,on a pitch have no terrors for a good batsman with a stout
2484,"heart , a firm grip on the willow and a hefty contempt for"
2485,batting averages and all the statistical blight that makes a
2486,mighty six these days as rare as frostbite in summer .
2487,They 'll be clapping the man who plays a straight theodolite next .
2488,EICHMANN continues # to reveal the extraordinary divisions of the
2489,German mind . Not content with arguing that he was only an
2490,"efficient cog in the machine , he now claims that part of the"
2491,endless massacre that led to the death of six million Jews was
2492,""" decent , feasible and workable . """
2493,"He feels satisfaction "" from the fact that my personality had been"
2494,"tested and weighed and not found wanting . "" He feels like"
2495,Pontius Pilate who washed his hands before the multitude
2496,"saying : "" I am innocent of the blood of this just person . """
2497,"Like Dr. Globke , whom I interviewed the other day , Eichmann"
2498,said :
2499,""" I drew a certain solace from the fact that I did what I"
2500,"could despite my low rank . "" Eichmann is on dangerous ground"
2501,when he pleads that he was only a small unit on the base
2502,"of the triangle that led to Hitler , Himmler , Hess and Goering"
2503,at the apex . In examination he betrayed an expert and
2504,intimate knowledge of every link in the chain of command that
2505,led to the top .
2506,He understood the whole apparatus with an exact and
2507,meticulous comprehension that could only have come from a man
2508,who used the system - and used it with power and authority .
2509,The appalling thing about the Germans is that they can kid them-
2510,selves and feel a sense of righteousness when their hands are
2511,red with blood .
2512,They really believed that the Treaty of Versailles
2513,was an iniquitous injustice . When they burst into
2514,"Czechoslovakia , Poland , Holland , Belgium and France"
2515,they really believed Hitler when he screamed at
2516,"them that they were being "" encircled . "" They really"
2517,"believed in the moral superiority of "" The New"
2518,"Order "" which Himmler on October 4 , 1943 , expressed"
2519,"thus : "" Whether nations live in prosperity or starve"
2520,to death like cattle interests me only in so far as we
2521,need them as slaves to # our Kultur ; otherwise
2522,it is of no interest to me .
2523,This concept of slavery included Britain .
2524,General Brauchitsch signed a directive
2525,ordering that after the successful
2526,"invasion of our islands all the "" able-bodied"

2532,to have been our destination .
2533,"In no other conquered country , not even"
2534,"Poland , had the Germans begun with such a"
2535,drastic step . There is no doubt that the compatriots
2536,of Eichmann would have been as good as their
2537,evil word . THE Inland Revenue people have a
2538,thankless task . But they do not make
2539,themselves less disliked by their attitude
2540,to their customers - who incidentally
2541,pay their salaries .
2542,Their demands are invariably couched in
2543,"hectoring , out-of-date language , but in spite of all"
2544,"their bluster , they let many a big fish through the"

2560,"SOME 17 years ago , in the early summer of 1934 ,"
2561,the German ambassador in London was dictating
2562,"a secret report to his chief von Papen , in Berlin ."
2563,""" Britain is uncomfortable in her role of champion"
2564,"of German rearmament , in opposition , to France . """
2565,Later that year he warned that Britain knew
2566,Germany was breaking the agreement to stop
2567,"building bombers , and added :"
2568,""" Without Britain's tolerance German rearma-"
2569,"ment in the air would be jeopardised . "" When"
2570,"Hoesch's reports , along with other nazi documents ,"
2571,were captured and published after the war the
2572,pattern of British Government connivance became
2573,"clear . At nazi Germany's request , Britain was"
2574,providing the cloak for Germany to build an
2575,air force bigger than that of France .
2576,"Yesterday West German Defence Minister ,"
2577,"Herr Strauss , started talks with the British"
2578,"Defence Minister , Mr. Watkinson . Their talks"
2579,"are another stage in the cloak operation ,"
2580,"1961 variety , by which the West German"
2581,militarists are advancing their rearmament .
2582,Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October
2583,that his policy was to make his country
2584,"the "" strongest militarily in Europe and the"
2585,"United States' principal Nato ally . """
2586,His job is to build up the military apparatus which
2587,will back West Germany's economic domination of Western
2588,Europe through the Common Market . He continued this week
2589,the argument with Mr. Watkinson which he had in public at a
2590,Nato council meeting last year over the question : do we
2591,fight a 30-day war or a 90-day war ?
2592,"A 90-day war , the West German"
2593,"view , provides the pretext for huge"
2594,German armed forces ( within Nato
2595,of course ) and for those to have
2596,bases all over Western Europe .
2597,In the past year West Germany
2598,has secured agreements for
2599,""" facilities "" in France , Holland and"
2600,Belgium . After much bargaining
2601,the British Government has
2602,"agreed to give similar "" facilities """
2603,The process has been too slow for Herr
2604,Strauss and last month he attacked
2605,Britain for being an obstacle for West Germany's
2606,"plans for a "" unified supply apparatus """
2607,in Nato . ( A supply apparatus which would
2608,link together the various West German
2609,""" facilities . "" ) By the end of the year there"
2610,will be 11 German divisions in Nato
2611,compared with four divisions of
2612,British troops .
2613,Alongside these divisions a force of over 600
2614,Starfighters provided by the Americans is growing
2615,"up . These "" fighters "" are in fact fighter bombers"
2616,which could launch an atomic attack on
2617,Eastern Europe . By 1963 the Germans plan to have
2618,"nine missile battalions , with 288 missiles and"
2619,"36 firing ramps , including weapons like Matador"
2620,"( range 950 miles ) , also provided by the Americans ."
2621,Last month West Germany was
2622,reported to be halfway toward
2623,"this target . Her position as "" America's"
2624,"principal Nato ally "" grows stronger"
2625,and stronger . Now this target which
2626,Herr Strauss and his fellows
2627,have their eyes on is control of the
2628,warheads to these weapons . General
2629,"Heusinger , the man who caused"
2630,a great disturbance last autumn
2631,All this has been achieved through Nato under
2632,American leadership . But a big role has been
2633,played not only by the British Government but
2634,by Right-Wing Labour in this country . They have
2635,"helped build up Nato and rearm Western Germany ,"
2636,in pursuit of the old familiar anti-Soviet
2637,policy which brought disaster in 1939 .
2638,Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained
2639,and Britain must stay in it to keep the Germans in
2640,"control . Nato , far from being a means of controlling"
2641,"the German militarists , is , in fact , the cover for"
2642,"building up their power . What must Britain do ? Today ,"
2643,"again , she has a key role . Let her tell men like Strauss"
2644,"that he shall have no bases or "" facilities , "" no help in"
2645,his quest for atomic arms .
2646,A policy which breaks with military
2647,alliances like Nato and seeks friendship
2648,with the Soviet Union can prevent another
2649,betrayal like that of the '30s . Shipbuilding

2653,which fought for and still stands on the
2654,policy decisions established at the Scar-
2655,borough Labour Party Conference I am
2656,appalled at the character of the current
2657,For many years my union had to present its views
2658,to the two major conferences of the movement and
2659,"take a licking . For us , unity meant accepting"
2660,unpalatable majority decisions as binding on the
2661,movement and having a go next time . Alongside
2662,"many others , we conducted our fight by putting"
2663,down # unambiguous alternatives to
2664,official policy and seeking to win majorities
2665,for them .
2666,When Scarborough carried our point of view
2667,"we were naturally delighted , more so because"
2668,the alternatives had been put clearly to the
2669,"movement , which had then chosen a vigorous"
2670,"anti-Nato , anti-Tory , anti-bomb and anti-German"
2671,rearmament policy . Hopes rose as we saw a
2672,perspective of sharp struggle based on consistent
2673,lines of difference with the Tories . Many members
2674,understood that the bread-and-butter struggles
2675,of the union would become easier in the context
2676,"For we have always felt , even"
2677,if we have then by our practice
2678,"ignored it , the inconsistency"
2679,between support for the war
2680,"alliance , with resulting colossal"
2681,"spending on armaments , and our"
2682,basic effort to improve living
2683,"standards . Instead , we saw the"
2684,Gaitskellites using the position
2685,of organisational dominance
2686,established during their years
2687,They obstructed every effort to fight for the
2688,"Scarborough decisions , while # scratching"
2689,around frantically to overturn them next
2690,time . Confusion of the original issue
2691,"by misrepresentation of the decisions ,"
2692,the introduction of a pseudo third way
2693,"and the call for party unity - in effect ,"
2694,a demand that the movement unite
2695,with the Gaitskellites on their policy
2696,and no other seems to have done the
2697,trick of moving a number of unions
2698,It would become easy to become cynical and
2699,"to despair . And yet , wherever the issues were put"
2700,"clearly , sections of the movement reaffirmed their"
2701,original stand . Only where the issues were
2702,posed so as to cause doubt and confusion
2703,were positions lost . It is my view that this
2704,immediate confusion hides the fact that the
2705,Peace movement is still advancing and that
2706,clarification of the issues can bring a
2707,majority to # secure the Scarborough
2708,decisions .
2709,Powerful units have stood firm .
2710,In unions where the central issues
2711,"were confused , clear policy details -"
2712,as on bases - were decisively carried .
2713,"This , and the numbers of active"
2714,workers who are beginning to understand
2715,"how and why the trick was done ,"
2716,"provides a strong , immediate basis"
2717,for a campaign against weak and
2718,"doubtful positions , and for a consistent"
2719,peace policy .
2720,All recent events show how correct the
2721,Scarborough decisions were . The Kennedy
2722,"Administration's sharpened policies , the"
2723,speeded-up drive to improve West
2724,"Germany's armament , the new attempt"
2725,to rush Britain into the European Common
2726,"Market , and the kite-flying on Spain"
2727,present a whole new proof that to abandon
2728,Scarborough is to expose Britain and her
2729,working class to sharp new dangers - that
2730,Gaitskellism is bankrupt .
2731,Ordinary working people will never
2732,rally to defend a policy founded on
2733,political chicanery or elect a Labour
2734,Government to carry through Tory policy -
2735,Gaitskell's stupid hope . The tragedy is
2736,that enormous inroads could already
2737,have been made into Tory strength by
2738,"a fighting policy , based on Scarborough ."
2739,THE desire for unity in the Labour and
2740,trade union movement following the
2741,At the same time that unity cannot be
2742,"established on a false basis , or by creating"
2743,further confusion within the movement . Unity
2744,will never be established on the basis of leaders
2745,being a law unto themselves and opposing
2746,conference decisions when it suits their own
2747,convenience . Unity can never be established by
2748,any formula uniting those who oppose German
2749,"troops being trained on British soil and Polaris ,"
2750,and those who are for this policy - which is the
2751,same as that of the Tory Government .
2752,It is impossible for Labour's new Defence state-
2753,ment to unite the movement as the Labour
2754,leaders are not only in favour of American
2755,"bases , but are in favour of German bases and"
2756,troops being trained on British soil . The new
2757,"Defence statement , while accepting that Britain can-"
2758,"not remain an independent nuclear Power , now"
2759,supports the policy of depending on American
2760,"nuclear weapons and the H-bomb , placing"
2761,Britain in an even more dangerous position .
2762,The statement of Padley and Crossman is no
2763,different in principle to the new defence statement .
2764,"They accept American nuclear bases , and also"
2765,the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy
2766,until some future date . They deceive the people
2767,by their talk of political and collective control
2768,of Nato . The Pentagon has made it perfectly
2769,"clear who controls the American H-bomb , and"
2770,who will actually give the instructions to press
2771,the button for nuclear warfare .
2772,There is only one way to develop unity and
2773,at the same time defend Britain . This
2774,was shown at the Scottish Trades Union
2775,"Congress , representing 800,000 organised"
2776,"trade unionists , when it decided by overwhelming"
2777,"votes , to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions"
2778,"on unilateral disarmament , and to oppose"
2779,Polaris and military bases being installed on
2780,"the Holy Loch , or any other part of Britain ."
2781,Such a policy would unite the whole movement
2782,and lay the basis for the defeat of the
2783,"present Tory Government , which has become a"
2784,real menace to the British people both in
2785,home and foreign policy . It is quite evident
2786,that the movement will go on record against
2787,the Polaris base and facilities for German bases
2788,and military training .
2789,This should strengthen the campaign to
2790,end the manufacture and use of
2791,nuclear weapons in Britain . Britain then
2792,could play a leading and independent
2793,role for an international agreement to ban
2794,all nuclear strategy and weapons of mass
2795,"destruction , and lay the basis for real"
2796,peace and progress . WHEN all the
2797,ballyhoo about Commonwealth Training
2798,Week subsides it is doubtful whether more
2799,than a handful of new apprenticeships
2800,This week of window dressing will not prevent
2801,most of the hopeful 15-year-olds leaving school
2802,in six weeks time from ending up in blind alley
2803,"jobs . It needs more than 10,000 church parades"
2804,"and open days at techs , more than descents into"
2805,Brighton's sewers or balloon ascents over
2806,Wolverhampton for Britain's technical training to
2807,catch up with the space age .
2808,"The heli-hopping Duke of Edinburgh ,"
2809,"opening a few technical college extensions ,"
2810,will not keep us abreast of the
2811,"scientific revolution . Out of the 550,000"
2812,young people aged 15-17 starting
2813,work in 1960 420000 ( 73 per cent )
2814,went into unskilled work . The per-
2815,centage is expected to swell to 80
2816,"next year . The Duke , possibly"
2817,"speaking from experience , stated :"
2818,But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people
2819,prefer unskilled jobs . Countless numbers who want training
2820,are denied it . One area electricity board in 1958
2821,offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450
2822,"applications , of whom 100 were considered suitable by"
2823,the board . There were only 17 vacancies for the 58
2824,boys who passed the Admiralty exams for Rosyth
2825,dockyard last year .
2826,The production by Bill Duncalf
2827,compressed a long and sometimes rambling
2828,story into a concentrated comprehensive
2829,survey of a life work . P. J. K. HANS WERNER
2830,"HENZE'S "" Elegy for Young Lovers "" is the first"
2831,"unambiguously "" contemporary "" work to be"
2832,admitted to the Glyndebourne canon . By no
2833,"means a masterpiece , it is in many respects"
2834,a representative modern work and the composer
2835,is a highly skilled manipulator of contemporary
2836,"idioms , with a strong sense of words and situation ."
2837,"The libretto , by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman ,"
2838,is largely a satire on the petty court
2839,"surrounding an ageing poet , whose deeply"
2840,egocentric character leads him to sacrifice
2841,everything to his need of inspiration . Henze
2842,obtains his musical characterisation by means
2843,"of individual instrumental timbres and "" personal """
2844,"intervals , and the result is often less delineation"
2845,"of character than caricature . This is also the chief ,"
2846,or at least the most successfully executed trait
2847,"of the libretto , which contains an odd blend of highly"
2848,The evil that Byron did certainly lived after
2849,"him , and was even outmatched by the"
2850,mischief perpetrated by almost every person
2851,who had been close to him . In turning over
2852,the bones Doris Langley Moore has brought
2853,to light a great deal of discreditable
2854,behaviour and a vision of mischief-
2855,making propensities of the leisured
2856,classes in the early 19th century which
2857,leaves one a little breathless .
2858,"AFTER ten days of intermittent , near fatal"
2859,"ennui , the eleventh Berlin International"
2860,Film Festival was suddenly jolted back to
2861,"life by two extraordinary films , Bernhard"
2862,"Wicki's "" Das Wunder des Malachias "" ( "" The"
2863,"Miracle of Father Malachias "" ) and Michael-"
2864,"angelo Antonioni's "" La Notte . "" The num-"
2865,ber of German film directors who have
2866,made first rate works in the last 25 years
2867,can be counted on the fingers of one
2868,It would now seem that Wicki's name must
2869,"be added to this list , for his new film"
2870,may well be a landmark in the revitali-
2871,sation of the German cinema . Wicki is
2872,not only a director . He began his career
2873,"as an actor , had his first important"
2874,"film ro*?5le in Ka""utner's "" Die letzt"
2875,"Bru""cke , "" and he also appears in the"
2876,new Antonioni film .
2877,In 1950 he began to take photographs not
2878,only in Germany but also in Africa and
2879,America . An exhibition of these works which
2880,is now on view in a Berlin gallery is most im-
2881,"pressive . As Friedrich Du""rrenmatt , the Swiss"
2882,"playwright and author , wrote : "" Wicki's blacks"
2883,and greys are not only the colours of the
2884,"lost and the forgotten , but they are also the"
2885,technical means of abstraction .
2886,"Every unnecessary detail , all superfluous local"
2887,colouring must be eliminated . He does not
2888,"want the accuracy of a police photograph ,"
2889,but rather he wants to show the eternal in
2890,"every instant . "" The chilling horror of "" Mala-"
2891,"chias "" is due as much to Wicki the photo-"
2892,grapher as to Wicki the director . His earlier
2893,"film , "" Die Bru""cke , "" was equally terrifying ,"
2894,but here the director moves out of the world
2895,of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum
2896,Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with
2897,"considerable fidelity , the film tells the story"
2898,of a little monk who prays that a disrepu-
2899,table night club near his church be re-
2900,moved . One night his prayer is answered
2901,and the offending establishment is suddenly
2902,transplanted to an island in the North Sea .
2903,But Father Malachias's troubles have only
2904,"begun . Instead of having the desired effect ,"
2905,the miracle becomes exploited by a group
2906,Soon a carnival springs up on the sight of
2907,the missing building . The Church rebukes the
2908,"poor monk for his miracle , and as a"

2950,This director is at last being re-evaluated and
2951,given his proper place in the history of the
2952,German film . Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek

3546,"NEXT month that friendly , effervescent performer Frankie"
3547,Vaughan will burst on to the London Palladium stage
3548,in a new show . To paraphrase his well-known ditty :
3549,""" He 'll have the limelight , they 'll give him the girls -"
3550,"and leave the rest to him . """
3551,I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the
3552,"old , star-studded West End than he will ever feel in"
3553,"Hollywood . His American bosses , 20th-Century Fox , have"
3554,"recently given Frankie the full , razzamataz , red-carpet"
3555,treatment . But they haven't done a thing for his film
3556,career that Anna Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not
3557,"doing better here , before the platinum-plated Hollywood"
3558,carrot was dangled before his nose .
3559,"In his first Hollywood picture , "" Let 's Make Love , "" he"
3560,was swamped by the know-how of Marilyn Monroe
3561,"and Yves Montand . Against this couple Frankie , in"
3562,"a cardboard role , didn't stand a chance . Now comes"
3563,""" The Right Approach "" ( Rialto , "" A "" ) , and it 's a glum"
3564,business . He plays an aspiring actor - a
3565,"selfish , arrogant , brash , ambitious , unscrupulous heel -"
3566,who would tread on anybody's neck to get a break in
3567,the Hollywood ratrace .
3568,"He double-crosses the five pals with whom he lives ,"
3569,cheats a waitress ( Juliet Prowse ) and cynically uses
3570,a magazine editress ( Martha Hyer ) to get ahead .
3571,Frankie Vaughan is too nice a chap to ring quite
3572,"true as a smooth-tongued , ill-mannered Yank . His"
3573,best moments are when he swings breezily into the
3574,title song .
3575,"But 6,000 miles seems a heck of a way to go"
3576,for a new hit song . He might be well advised to
3577,think hard and long before his next jump into the
3578,Hollywood arena .
3579,VERDICT : Vaughan should have by-passed this approach .
3580,RONALD Lewis has just left for his first taste of the
3581,"Hollywood treatment , thanks to a sound performance in"
3582,""" Taste of Fear "" ( Warner Theatre , "" X "" ) ."
3583,He has earned his break . The film is a well-made
3584,variation on that sinister yarn in which half the cast
3585,try to persuade the heroine that she is out of her mind .
3586,Despite flagrant cheating the eerie atmosphere is
3587,built up neatly . Susan Strasberg is the crippled
3588,damsel in distress .
3589,Stepmother Ann Todd and doctor Christopher Lee are
3590,also effectively around . They provide some chilly red
3591,"herrings in this "" Find-the-body "" thriller . VERDICT :"
3592,Don't believe all you see and hear !
3593,NOT for the first time the homely mug of Sidney
3594,"James has pumped life into a slim , strained"
3595,"comedy . He does his rescue act in "" Double Bunk """
3596,"( Leicester-square Theatre , "" A "" ) ."
3597,Navigator Sid is a tower of strength when
3598,newly-weds Ian Carmichael and Janette Scott let
3599,loose their ancient houseboat on a honeymoon trip down
3600,"the river . The film starts off brightly enough but ,"
3601,"half-way through , the plot ( as well as the boat ) springs"
3602,a near-disastrous leak . Familiar members of Britain's
3603,repertory team of comedy character-actors jump through
3604,equally familiar hoops to mild laughter .
3605,"VERDICT : The "" bunk "" needed doubling ."
3606,DONALD HOUSTON had a big success on A T V's
3607,""" Drama '61 "" last night as a smooth ,"
3608,scheming jewel thief in a play by Jacques
3609,"Gillies , "" The Takers . "" A polished production"
3610,"by Quentin Lawrence , here , held together"
3611,by Mr. Houston's accomplished
3612,performance as the master mind behind a
3613,gang of crooks .
3614,"This plot to rob a French millionaire of 300,000"
3615,worth of jewellery struck me as ingenious . The play
3616,"had style , moved at a quick pace and everyone did"
3617,well . But it was Mr. Houston's evening .
3618,"Earlier , on the Palladium show I found Stanley"
3619,Holloway's act too long and not particularly
3620,entertaining . It was also a mistake to
3621,re-book Gene Detroy and his performing chimpanzees
3622,so soon after their previous appearance .
3623,Their offering last night differed little
3624,from their earlier act on this show a week
3625,"or so ago . But the Mudlarks , with Jeff Mudd"
3626,out of the Army and back with sister Mary
3627,"and brother Fred , were in bright , zestful"
3628,"form . Why only two numbers , though ? It"
3629,"was not enough . "" A FAIR COP , "" the B B C"
3630,"Whitehall farce last night , looked like"
3631,a rabbit warren in a field of corn .
3632,I can't recall a production where so many
3633,comics bolted in and out of holes so often .
3634,The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old
3635,lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead
3636,of his trousers . The action moved at tremendous
3637,"speed , backed by some wonderful timing by"
3638,the cast . I especially liked the tea-cup
3639,scene where six of the cast changed
3640,cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers .
3641,Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble
3642,as Smiler Perkins were the most laughable . They
3643,alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut
3644,through the gormless standing corn around them . Perhaps
3645,it was accidental - I hope not . If ever a bag of
3646,humour needed a thorough shaking up the Whitehall
3647,farce is it when it comes to television .
3648,"HOW do you get on records ? Well , you 've got"
3649,to have something different . Sing slightly flat .
3650,All the good singers sing in tune . Twang a guitar
3651,slightly off key . Everybody 's fed up with the
3652,right way - so the best-seller charts say . Play
3653,an OLD 2pianna instead of a new one . You got to
3654,"get it into your head , son ... people"
3655,don't like things as they should be - not on
3656,"record , anyway ."
3657,"Thus , musician David Lisbon's chances of being a starred"
3658,disc solo pianist were greatly enhanced when he dug out

3663,enough tacks and he got only the middle hammers done .
3664,Then he tried it out for sound . Um-chink ...
3665,um-chink ... it went . Slightly flat and jangly in
3666,part . DELIGHTFUL ! He put the sound on tape . The
3667,tape went to the Philips company . Within two
3668,days Mr. Lisbon had a record contract . And they
3669,hauled his thumb-tacked joanna the thirteen
3670,miles to London for his first session .
3671,"Now along comes his solo disc , featuring two of his own"
3672,"compositions , "" Deerstalker "" and "" Almost Grown Up . "" VERDICT :"
3673,"Mr. Lisbon has it taped . And tacked . And he says : "" Just as well"

3675,"different ... . "" More news from the ivory-thumping dept. ..."

3677,"comes in with another of his own works : "" Parade of the"

3679,But not one of his nimble-fingered best . GERMANY'S Russ
3680,Conway is a pianist who calls himself CRAZY OTTO . But
3681,nothing crazy about his pianistics . He pounds merrily away
3682,"at a piece called "" Piccadilly "" ( Polydor ) . I find it cute ."

3687,"Rolly Daniels , who comes 5,000 miles"
3688,from India to seek disc fame . Comedian Hal
3689,"Monty saw him in Bombay , became his manager ."
3690,And such is Hal's faith that he brings him to
3691,Europe . Now Rolly gets his big break - a
3692,"record , the modern Aladdin's lamp of"
3693,show business .
3694,Become a success with a disc and hey presto ! You 're a star ... . Rolly sings with
3695,"assuredness "" Bella Bella Marie "" ( Parlophone ) , a lively song that changes tempo mid-way ."
3696,"I don't think he will storm the charts with this one , but it 's a good start ."

3779,IT is mid-morning on a Dublin Sunday . The streets
3780,"are tranquilly sunny and still , for the town"

3990,four years later of a German-
3991,born Bronx carpenter named

3996,The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
3997,the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
3998,"plan and to the different public for which , or against which , the author wrote ."
3999,The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel .
4000,There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
4001,Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations . The
4002,present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history . The
4003,"original was written on a roll , or codex , which fell into disorder or was"
4004,"accidentally damaged . An editor , who was not the author , made what he"
4005,"could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order ."
4006,Most of those who expound a theory of textual
4007,dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was
4008,written entirely by one author before the
4009,disturbance took place but a few leave it open
4010,to suppose that the original book had been
4011,revised even before the upheaval . The ingenuity
4012,of the theories is impressive and is the best
4013,argument against them .
4014,Thomas Spreng
4015,The one real weakness of the Commentator's
4016,"case is that , in common with all his colleagues ,"
4017,"he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly"
4018,how this enlargement was effected nor has he
4019,been able to explain the textual movements by
4020,showing that such changes are part of a
4021,simple and coherent plan . To understand how
4022,this is possible it is necessary to examine the
4023,text of the Gospel .
4024,THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
4025,written in Greek . A modern text of the
4026,Gospel represents the work of generations of
4027,scholars who have compared the many manu-
4028,scripts of John and worked out the version
4029,which is most likely to have been the original
4030,wording . It is not possible to establish any one
4031,text with absolute precision .
4032,The most convenient one for the authors
4033,has been the text of A. Souter . In this
4034,version of the text the Fourth Gospel is
4035,"printed as just over 1,000 different nouns ,"
4036,"verbs , and other parts of speech occurring"
4037,"15,695 times in their different grammatical"
4038,forms . There are other texts which could
4039,"have been used , and ( as shown in Table 1 )"
4040,it is not a matter of the greatest importance
4041,which text is used .
4042,At first sight the difference between
4043,Souter and the other texts is rather
4044,large . But the British text includes
4045,"the paragraph 7.53-8.11 , the Woman"
4046,"taken in Adultery , and this accounts"
4047,"for 178 words out of 279 , which is"
4048,"the difference between the 15,695 words"
4049,"of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's ."
4050,The omission or inclusion of this paragraph
4051,is a matter of editorial decision rather
4052,"The bar was the commonest marking , but others"
4053,were also used . Dots sometimes served in place of the
4054,"bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as"
4055,it is now used to mark a paragraph ending . Frequently
4056,paragraphos markings were omitted . C. H. Roberts is of
4057,the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
4058,"some markings would be used , although which , it is"
4059,impossible to say .
4060,Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
4061,the original of the Gospel would be unmarked . The
4062,"original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,"
4063,"whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in"
4064,columns . This is the invariable practice of ancient
4065,manuscripts . A common size of column would hold
4066,about one third of a page of Souter's print .
4067,The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
4068,and the sheet wound round this central pin . The roll made
4069,a simple and serviceable book . It was robust - the number
4070,which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
4071,this - and it was easily stored . It had two disadvantages . It
4072,"was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not"
4073,an easy form of book in which to find a
4074,reference .
4075,This last objection might have had some weight in
4076,"ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,"
4077,the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
4078,As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
4079,"overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his"
4080,information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
4081,The other form of book was the codex . In this the
4082,sheets were bound together down one edge much as
4083,they are in modern books .
4084,Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
4085,might be bulky . It is sometimes possible to tell
4086,whether or not a particular text was written on
4087,a roll or a codex . Rolls were prepared for
4088,"writing , but any papyrus left unused at the"
4089,end could be cut off . If the text was longer than
4090,"the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on ."
4091,"The verso of the roll was blank , and one"
4092,"cannot think of an author , Mark for example ,"
4093,"sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,"
4094,while one whole side of his roll was unused .
4095,The codex form was not so accommodating . Even
4096,"in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra"
4097,sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
4098,"over the binding , or the whole codex rebound ."
4099,Close to the building projects would be the
4100,VINEYARDS ( 1 Kings 4.25 ; S. of Sol. 8.11 ) .
4101,"The word is a Persian loan-word ,"
4102,"pairi-deaza , from which our word paradise"
4103,is derived . Qoheleth has a second
4104,paradise at his disposal but he is
4105,no happier than Adam was !
4106,The word is used in the singular
4107,in Neh. 2.8 and S. of Sol. 4.13 .
4108,A natural transition from gardens and
4109,orchards to the vital question of water
4110,supply . The pools are probably natural springs
4111,enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in
4112,the rock . King Mesha of Moab boasts of their
4113,"construction in lines 9 , 23-25 of the Moabite Stone ,"
4114,which read : And I built Baal-meon and made
4115,in it the reservoir ... and I made both the
4116,reservoirs for water inside the town .
4117,"According to the legend , Solomon had asked the"
4118,"Prince of the Demons , "" Ashmodeus "" to bring him"
4119,the Shamir and Ashmodeus told him that the
4120,"Shamir had not been placed under his charge , as"
4121,there is no Shamir in Gehenna ( Hell ) . An eagle
4122,"brought the Shamir to Solomon from Eden ,"
4123,"the Paradise , the only place where the Shamir"
4124,could be found .
4125,The Talmud describes that the Shamir lives in
4126,"a sanctuary , and only some rare birds know"
4127,"the existence of it . These birds are , the Cherubim"
4128,and the Seraphim . We are also told that the Shamir
4129,"is the stylus used by Moses , and this stylus is described"
4130,as a very precious diamond-stone and very adamant .
4131,The word Shamir was used as a
4132,personal name ( Git. 68a ) . The Hebrew
4133,"word "" SHAMIR "" means guarded or preser-"
4134,"ved . Therefore , the real man , who"
4135,"regards himself as insignificant , as the"
4136,"prayer says : "" What am I ? A worm "" , he"
4137,is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
4138,"the Shmah , loves the Lord God with"
4139,"all his heart , and with all his soul and"
4140,with all his might and studies the
4141,word of God .
4142,"This man is the worm , the creature that"
4143,cuts and polishes Altar-Stones . Such
4144,a man is the Shamir that guards him-
4145,self against all the irrelevant pleasures .
4146,Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
4147,"to mould our character , to melt our"
4148,heart of stone . This Shamir helps
4149,us earthly creatures to build an Altar
4150,for God to come nearer to God .
4151,The action of the Shamir writes books and their
4152,books are readable . This Shamir is indeed a rare
4153,"diamond that incises the hardest rock , the hardest"
4154,facts . And these creatures existed from the
4155,"beginning . It is "" the stone , which the builders"
4156,"refused , but it is to become the head-stone"
4157,"of the corner "" . ( Ps. 118 , 22 . ) And the stone shall"
4158,tell !
4159,""" For the stone shall cry out of the wall "" , like"
4160,"Baalam's ass , "" and the purlin of timber shall"
4161,"creak in answer "" "" if the roof of our security is"
4162,"crushing our soul "" ( see Hab. 2 , 10-11 ) . And it is"
4163,"through the Shamir : "" That the earth shall be"
4164,filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
4165,"Lord , as the waters cover the sea . "" ( Hab. 2 , 14 . )"
4166,"The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue ,"
4167,"which is written on two plates , the hard facts"
4168,"of life , and all facts are "" one "" . We have all"
4169,come across human Shamirs and they leave
4170,a deep impression on our feelings and senses .
4171,They make us the Altar for God to emit
4172,the Light which can be read in every
4173,"language . The Shamir is the "" seventh "" and"
4174,"most important creature , that was created on"
4175,"the eve of the Sabbath , to bring the"
4176,"Sabbath , real peace to the whole world ."
4177,"Then the whole earth will be His Altar . "" And it"
4178,"shall come to pass , if 1ye shall 1hearken"
4179,"diligently unto my commandments , which I command"
4180,"you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to"
4181,serve Him with all your heart and with all
4182,"your soul . "" This may seem very good , but there"
4183,is something deficient .
4184,Under such conditions without putting your
4185,mind together we cannot solve the further
4186,"summons of destiny , to solve the economic"
4187,problems . Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben
4188,"Jochai ( Tanis 6a ) "" if Israel does not fulfil"
4189,"the wish of the Lord , failing to serve the"
4190,"Lord God with all their visionary power ,"
4191,the work will have to be done by each
4192,"individual "" ."
4193,"They will not work in union . If physical power , spiritual power"
4194,"and visionary power is not united , man will remain in his heart"
4195,selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to
4196,"gratify selfish aims , then each man will gather-in"
4197,"for himself only , instead of all to help to gather your"
4198,"corn , your wine and your oil ."
4199,Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor
4200,"freedom from fear , fear of starvation in the"
4201,midst of plenty . Help will not be easily forth-
4202,coming for the people in need . They will
4203,think of the animals first ( which is of course
4204,our duty ) . Of course the individual will
4205,"eat and be full but : "" Take heed to yourself ,"
4206,"that your heart be not deceived , and 1ye turn"
4207,"aside , and serve other gods , and worship them "" ,"
4208,"the yourself is thy greatest enemy , the self-"
4209,seeking self .
4210,And you serve Mammon and God . And you cannot serve
4211,"two masters , and you worship self-interest , isolating"
4212,"yourself , under such conditions the goods are your gods ."
4213,""" And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you , and he"
4214,"shut up the heavens , that there is no rain , and that the land"
4215,yield not her fruit and lest 1ye perish quickly from off the
4216,"good land which the Lord 1giveth you . """
4217,For without the vision to serve the Lord your God with all
4218,your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
4219,"the problem of life cannot be solved . "" Therefore shall 1ye lay"
4220,"up these my words in your heart and in your soul . "" The text"
4221,"adds and in your soul , searching your soul ."
4222,And the sequence in the text is different than
4223,"in the first part of the Shmah , we have first "" and"
4224,"to bind them for a sign upon your hand , that"
4225,"they may be as frontlets between your eyes . "" First to"

4228,"ne through the mill , we need not teach them"
4229,to the children any more diligently and the
4230,children will grasp now what will befall
4231,them without visionary power .
4232,And we will nail the Divine Law on the
4233,door posts of the house and upon the gates .
4234,""" That your days may be multiplied and the"

4239,( Talmud Sanh. 99A ) .
4240,"The Messusah , which is nailed on the doorposts"
4241,contains those two lessons . The third lesson
4242,"of the Shmah ( Numbers 15 , 37-41 ) is"
4243,"called "" the going-out of the land of"
4244,"Egypt "" . It starts with the story of the fringes"
4245,"the "" tsitsits "" . This lesson used to be read"
4246,only in the morning . And the Talmud tells a
4247,"story , which is also in the Hagadah that"
4248,"Rabbi Eleasar ben Assarja said , "" I am"
4249,nearly seventy and I had not succeeded that

4256,should remember the Great
4257,Deliverance : Passover and its connection
4258,with the fringes ( the tsitsits ) .
4259,And the tsitsits had a message sealed inside the knots
4260,just as there is a message sealed in the four emblems which
4261,"are used on Passover , to depict the "" time of our freedom "" ."
4262,And they are ( 1 ) Matzo ; ( 2 ) Bitter Herbs ; ( 3 ) Salt-water and
4263,Charauses ( a kind of fruit mixture in likeness of the
4264,appearance of mortar ) ; and ( 4 ) an attitude to lean
4265,back .
4266,"( 1 ) Matzos is deficient bread , ( LECHEM ANJO in Hebrew ) ,"
4267,"so are we deficient without spiritual knowledge , and to"
4268,cure our mental incapacity we should be willing
4269,to learn . Education is always the most important task .
4270,Education gives : Freedom of Speech . ( 2 ) Bitter Herbs
4271,symbolises the bitterness that is hurled against us .
4272,"We eat it . We accept it , to show we have self-control"
4273,and that God dwells within us .
4274,Self-control gives us : Freedom to worship God . ( 3 ) Salt Water and Charauses :
4275,the salt-water at the Seder-Table represents the Covenant of the Torah
4276,"( MELACH BRITH ELOHECHO in Hebrew , Salt is the covenant of 1thy God ,"
4277,"Levit. 2 , 13 . ) Salt preserves and we should have this salt in"
4278,ourselves and have peace with one-another . And the sweet
4279,"Mortar ( the CHARAUSES in Hebrew ) that binds all the "" hard-"
4280,"facts "" together and explains them , represents the Oral"
4281,Tradition .
4282,"We dip into both , at the Seder . And we want to understand"
4283,"more of the Torah and the Oral Tradition , our inheritance ."
4284,"Living the life of the Torah ( "" dipping-in "" ) makes us"
4285,"meek : "" But the meek shall inherit the earth ; and shall"
4286,"delight themselves in the abundance of Peace "" ( Psalm 37 ,"
4287,11 ) . That gives us freedom from want .
4288,( 1 ) Matzo represents Peshat ; ( 2 ) Moraur
4289,represents Remez ; ( 3 ) Dipping-in represents
4290,Derush ; ( 4 ) Leaning-back represents Saud .
4291,( This is the PARDUS . ) Matzo represents
4292,the literal meaning of Pesach which
4293,is called : The Feast of Matzos . The
4294,Bitter-Herbs represent the spiritual
4295,"principle and this gives us "" a wink "" ( Remez )"
4296,how to live and accept all the bitterness
4297,that is hurled against us . The Salt-water
4298,and the sweet Mortar in which we dip-in represents
4299,the richness of the Law and that we should
4300,Leaning back carries the concealed message . And we
4301,"start the Seder showing the Matzos , that they rep-"
4302,"resent the "" Bread of Poverty "" which our fore-fathers"
4303,"were eating in Mitzrajim , to show they were willing to learn ;"
4304,and we invite anybody who wishes to partake in our
4305,"discussions , saying : "" Anybody who is hungry , let him come"
4306,"and eat , Anybody who is thirsty , let him come and"
4307,"drink . """
4308,And we want all to eat and drink His Great Philosophy of the
4309,"four ways of Israel's redemption . Hence "" four questions "" , which are"
4310,really interrogations to examine into the principles of the four re-
4311,"demptions are asked at the Seder-evening about these "" four"
4312,"symbols "" ( the MANISHTANO ) . And the person who asks these"
4313,questions is seeking the opinion of the one who is
4314,conducting the Seder .
4315,"And we answer , that the Lord our God gave us "" four freedoms """
4316,without which Society cannot make progress . And we drink
4317,""" four cups "" to thank the Lord our God for the "" four"
4318,"freedoms "" which are Divine . There are four ways of"
4319,redemption : ( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the
4320,burdens of Egypt . ( 2 ) I will rid you of their bondage .
4321,( 3 ) I will redeem you . ( 4 ) I will take you to me for a
4322,people . ( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the
4323,burdens of Egypt : How was it that Israel was
4324,brought out from under the burdens of Egypt ?
4325,"Because , they kept the Passover and they were"
4326,"eating Matzos in Egypt and the "" Feast of Matzos """
4327,was known even to Abraham and Lot .
4328,The new century opened with James 1 ascending
4329,the throne . He was quite prepared to be
4330,tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
4331,"spoiled that . The Puritans had high hopes , for"
4332,"James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland ,"
4333,"but those hopes were dashed . True , a new Prayer"
4334,Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
4335,derived little comfort from it .
4336,They objected to the word Absolution . So the phrase ' or
4337,the remission of sins ' was added . But Absolution remained .
4338,They objected to the word Confirmation . So the phrase
4339,' or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and
4340,able to render an account of their faith according
4341,to the Catechism following ' were added . But Confirmation
4342,remained . Other changes in the Book were equally
4343,minor except for the new section on the Sacraments
4344,added to the Catechism .
4345,This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
4346,"been the mood which produced the Black Rubric , for"
4347,"it says that ' the Body and Blood of Christ , which are"
4348,verily and indeed taken and received by the
4349,faithful in the Lord's Supper . ' It could hardly be more
4350,"definite . It was at this time , too , that King James made"
4351,himself immortal by becoming associated with
4352,a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
4353,( which was never actually authorized ! ) .
4354,In that year Shakespeare had just turned
4355,forty and had written Hamlet two years
4356,before . Bacon was at work and Milton was
4357,just learning to read . James was followed by
4358,"Charles , in whose reign came the Scottish"
4359,Prayer Book in 1637 . Significantly this made
4360,a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
4361,became the foster mother of some of the most
4362,important Prayer Books in the Anglican
4363,Communion .
4364,"Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud ,"
4365,now so much nobler a figure than former historians
4366,led us to believe . Laud was enthusiastically hated
4367,"by Calvinists and Puritans , and the sentiment was"
4368,mutual . But Laud was no Romanizer . One of his
4369,first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
4370,"the Jesuit , Fisher . But anyone who was friendly"
4371,"with James and Charles , the Puritans argued ,"
4372,was necessarily a menace .
4373,Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church ?
4374,Laud made a positive approach . He set out to increase
4375,a sense of reverence . The Prayer Book was to be respected
4376,and so was the office of a bishop . Altars should be
4377,"altars and not any broken down , transportable"
4378,table which was handy for the most improbable uses .
4379,In the first place it is not a great deal
4380,"of use telling even children , as I have"
4381,"already suggested , not to be silly or"
4382,to pull themselves together . Far better
4383,to help them to face whatever it is that
4384,"is worrying them , to find the original"
4385,cause and then deal with it ; show it
4386,up either for the sham it is - and many
4387,fears are based upon completely
4388,irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
4389,Even worse is to laugh . Tremendous damage may be done to a child
4390,"by laughing at what are very real fears . As adults , we know"
4391,"that their fears are groundless , indeed to us they appear laughable ,"
4392,but to a child they are very real . Not that I am suggesting
4393,that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
4394,"to face their fears , to see through them and come out on the"
4395,other side as victors .
4396,To ridicule them only pushes them farther
4397,"into themselves , so that they become"
4398,unable to speak about it to anybody and
4399,"the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown ,"
4400,the harvest of which may still be being
4401,reaped at forty or fifty . Far better to
4402,agree with a child that a particular
4403,"situation is frightening , and then to face"
4404,it together until the child can see how
4405,unnecessary its fears were .
4406,Because situations which may contain
4407,"all the elements of fear can arise suddenly ,"
4408,it is a good idea to condition a child
4409,to some extent against it . To keep a child
4410,of twelve or thirteen under the
4411,impression that nothing nasty ever
4412,"happens is not merely dishonest , it"
4413,is unwise . As I shall suggest in a
4414,later chapter there are some situations
4415,which occur less frequently than
4416,"A little more honesty , even if one refrains from going into"
4417,"too many details , would help many a child to make a"
4418,proper adjustment to life as it grows up . Let us look
4419,"at Jesus . We do not , I think , see there a life without fear ."
4420,There are several instances where he seemed unable to go
4421,on .
4422,In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
4423,should pass from Him . Jesus shows us
4424,the way to face life . To see all the latent
4425,frightening possibilities and yet by facing
4426,them and knowing God is with us and
4427,"that , with Him , there is nothing that can"
4428,"finally defeat us . More than that , that God"
4429,has something important to do with our
4430,"lives and that the nearer we get to Him ,"
4431,the stronger we become .
4432,... Today A wonderful thought In the
4433,dawn was given ... And the thought
4434,Was this : That a secret plan Is hid in
4435,"my hand ; That my hand is big Big ,"
4436,"Because of the plan That God , Who"
4437,"dwells in my hand , Knows this"
4438,"secret plan , Of the things He will"
4439,do for the world Using my hand .
4440,"Toyohiko Kagawa . Loving Saviour , who experienced"
4441,"all human emotion , and whose sensitive"
4442,"nature knows better than we do , what it is to"
4443,"be really afraid , help us to know that when"
4444,"we face life boldly , many of the shadows are"
4445,"seen to be allies and not enemies and that ,"
4446,"come what may , we are never alone when"
4447,we are with Thee .
4448,Amen . MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
4449,purely physical thing . The cure for which is sleep . This is only
4450,partly true . Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
4451,"amount of rest seems to make any difference . Sleep , to be"
4452,"effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes"
4453,from innocence .
4454,"To others , the long hours of the night bring"
4455,only a disturbed tossing and turning
4456,which causes them to wake feeling worse
4457,than when they went to bed . We may begin
4458,to understand this a little better when we
4459,realize that tiredness itself is largely in
4460,"the mind . Very few people , under normal"
4461,"conditions , work themselves to a standstill ."
4462,The mind tires first and conveys the impression
4463,of tiredness to the body . This can be proved by
4464,noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
4465,body who feels thoroughly tired . Suppose
4466,a mother has news late at night that her
4467,child is in danger . She will undertake a
4468,"journey which , an hour before , she would"
4469,have declared impossible .
4470,"Even more simply , test your own reactions"
4471,to different situations . There are some which
4472,bring on an almost immediate feeling of
4473,tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
4474,"the washing-up - while others , if they"
4475,"refer to something you like doing , bring a"
4476,veritable surge of energy . Many a girl who
4477,is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump
4478,up with no apparent tiredness at all when
4479,her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
4480,Nor is she necessarily being deceitful . She really did feel tired
4481,until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
4482,"attractive - interest ! Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do"
4483,with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion . A
4484,disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
4485,"of fatigue . They wonder why they get no rest at night ,"
4486,even if they do sleep .
4487,They drag themselves around and can become
4488,a burden to their families and their friends .
4489,Any mental confusion can cause this and
4490,the best way is probably to seek advice .
4491,As we are unable to cure our own bodies
4492,"if the cause of our pain is too deep seated ,"
4493,"so we are unable to cure our own minds ,"
4494,if the trouble is a complicated one
4495,involving careful and patient treatment .
4496,One of the greatest steps forward that has been
4497,made this century is the way in which illness
4498,"of the mind is no longer feared or shunned ,"
4499,and is in fact no differently regarded than
4500,"physical illness . There is , nevertheless , a"
4501,great deal of tiredness which comes from
4502,no major complication but results from an
4503,"inability to deal with life , especially under"
4504,the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
4505,century .
4506,"In the days when most people were born ,"
4507,lived and died within the boundaries of
4508,"the village , it was not difficult for anybody"
4509,to live a day at a time . Even those who
4510,held a high and responsible office lived in
4511,far greater simplicity than their successors .
4512,"When news from the Continent took days ,"
4513,"from America weeks , from the Far East ,"
4514,"months , even a Prime Minister could go to"
4515,sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
4516,"be happening at the other end of England ,"
4517,"In other ways , too , life for the ordinary"
4518,individual has become so complex
4519,that it taxes the mind . Two hundred
4520,"years ago , men lived and worked"
4521,"in one place , their lives were of one"
4522,"piece . Now a man may live twenty ,"
4523,thirty even sixty miles from his
4524,work . The only connexion is the
4525,pipeline of the railway on which they
4526,travel day by day .
4527,"In many cases , their homes know little of"
4528,their place of work and their associates at
4529,the office or works wonder what they
4530,are possibly like in the surroundings of their
4531,"homes . It is easy , desperately easy , to lead"
4532,a ' double ' life without ever deliberately
4533,planning to do so or in fact being conscious
4534,of what is going on . It is easier to live life in
4535,"compartments but over the years it builds up ,"
4536,and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
4537,need to be handled correctly .
4538,Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life
4539,"as fully as possible , without having our energy sapped by un-"
4540,necessary weariness . ( a ) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness .
4541,We have a saying ' My head will never save my feet ' . Time
4542,after time we forget something and have to go back
4543,upstairs or down to the shops .
4544,If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time -
4545,we lose this way in the course of a day we would be
4546,"staggered . Some of it is inevitable , and we do not want to"
4547,"become too pernickety . Nevertheless , we could all probably"
4548,be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle
4549,through .
4550,The housewife would find life far less tiring
4551,"if she made a list , followed a routine of work"
4552,rather than getting from one thing to the next .
4553,The business man would find that he reached
4554,the end of the day with far less strain if
4555,he was a little more systematic . To drift
4556,aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
4557,thing else . If we would only sit down and
4558,write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
4559,"be done and then work quietly through them ,"
4560,we would find life considerably less exhausting
4561,There may be some who will argue that
4562,"routine destroys the soul . It is so easy ,"
4563,"they say , to get into a rut . Save us"
4564,from the school curriculum and even
4565,worse the school system whereby for
4566,meals everybody knows beforehand
4567,"exactly what , on any given day of the"
4568,"week , they are going to have . If - such"
4569,a critic may say - you are calling
4570,"us to adventure , do not strangle us before"
4571,we start by putting us into a strait-jacket
4572,I am more than conscious of this . How anybody
4573,can go through the same routine day in and day
4574,out for forty years I find difficult to understand .
4575,A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and
4576,commerce may be kept going - though if ever
4577,it becomes possible to work out a system
4578,of ' staggered ' hours it may do an immense
4579,amount of good over and above relieving
4580,the pressure on over-crowded trains .
4581,"As it is , with so much of our life already"
4582,"in a predetermined groove , I would"
4583,hardly like to add further to the dullness
4584,which it engenders . But I am not arguing
4585,for this . I know how much of a drag it can be
4586,and I was interested some little while
4587,ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
4588,day timetable .
4589,"They only worked , of course , a five-"
4590,day week so that in the first week
4591,Monday to Friday were days one
4592,"to five of the timetable , the following"
4593,Monday was day six and Tuesday
4594,started day one again and so on .
4595,By this means they avoided each
4596,week being the same with a pupil
4597,knowing exactly what the subject
4598,would be on Friday afternoon at
4599,3 p.m. .
4600,"It was a little complicated to work ,"
4601,"of course , and there had to be a big"
4602,notice in the entrance saying which
4603,day of the timetable it was - but
4604,it added immensely to the interest
4605,and kept everybody on their toes .
4606,To have order does not mean getting
4607,into a dull routine . I have great
4608,sympathy with the young wife
4609,who does not always want to do
4610,the washing on a Monday .
4611,"I would not want to either , but if she wants to get through"
4612,"the day without becoming exhausted , she will be well advised to"
4613,sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to
4614,"do , note the order in which they can most conveniently be"
4615,done ( or must be done because of other predetermined factors
4616,"- you must , for example , do your shopping on the morning of"
4617,the early closing day ) .
4618,"She will , in fact , be surprised at what peace"
4619,of mind ensues . ( b ) Concentrate on one
4620,thing at a time . A list or a plan enables us to
4621,put all our energies into the particular
4622,matter on hand .
4623,"( Actually , the Mishnah quotes two further proof"
4624,"texts and the Gemara explains why these ,"
4625,"too , are necessary , but a careful examination"
4626,of that passage makes it clear that these are
4627,not quoted here because they are not
4628,necessary to prove the point made by
4629,"R. Joshua b. Levi . ) Finally , we note that"
4630,the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
4631,elsewhere .
4632,"From the above it follows that here , once again ,"
4633,we have a good illustration of how a
4634,sugya has been fashioned from material
4635,already in the hands of the Redactors .
4636,The sugya is built around the saying of
4637,R. Joshua b. Levi . The proof text for the
4638,reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
4639,with the comment given by Samuel .
4640,( This is probably to be understood as a well-
4641,known comment on the verse ; quoted by
4642,Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
4643,by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
4644,Levi's thesis ! ) The proof text of greeting by
4645,the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah .
4646,There is no reference to the Mishnah here
4647,because the Mishnah deals with the
4648,actual practice of greeting by the divine
4649,Name and the Gemara here quotes the
4650,texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi .
4651,The question and answer with regard to the
4652,need for the text of the angel are quoted
4653,here in the same words in which they are
4654,quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah .
4655,This can either mean that both sugyas are
4656,quoting a well-known question and
4657,answer or that our sugya is quoting from
4658,the longer sugya which deals with all
4659,four texts quoted in the Mishnah .
4660,Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
4661,original question and answer and this is quoted
4662,in the other sugya . ( This can be supported by the
4663,use of the expression : ' Boaz did it of his own
4664,accord but there was no approval of his action
4665,in Heaven ' in both sugyoth . Such an
4666,expression appears to have been framed in
4667,"response to the particular point at issue here ,"
4668,whether the Heavenly Court concurred
4669,in the decision of the human court . )
4670,The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
4671,is then quoted and the interpretation of the
4672,latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
4673,"is added , not because this is at all relevant"
4674,to the discussion but because it was
4675,a familiar interpretation which had
4676,become so well known that it was
4677,invariably quoted whenever the verse
4678,"itself was quoted , almost as if it were a"
4679,part of the verse .
4680,The Gemara continues with a saying of the
4681,"Palestinian teacher , R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) :"
4682,' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places :
4683,"the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah ,"
4684,and the court of Solomon . ' The place of this
4685,"saying here is obvious , it follows naturally"
4686,on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
4687,deals with a similar theme .
4688,We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys
4689,that he was a great man for lace - paying
4690,as much as 3 for a lace collar . But this
4691,didn't mean he was prepared to do as much
4692,"for his lady , for he records testily : ' My wife"
4693,and I fell out about my not being willing
4694,to have her gown laced . '
4695,"We read , with sympathy , an advertisement in the"
4696,reign of Charles 2 stating : ' Lost : a lawn 1hand-
4697,kercher with a broad hem laced round with
4698,fine Point lace about four fingers broad ' and
4699,among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an
4700,unpaid bill for ' scarlet satin shoes with
4701,silver lace ' . The records of these tender trifles
4702,are very touching but then lace does place
4703,upon everything a delicate sentiment .
4704,Lucky indeed are the families that
4705,possess a heritage of lace . A lace
4706,bridal veil handed down from mother
4707,"to daughters , a lace-trimmed Christening"
4708,robe that each generation wears in turn -
4709,"these are proud possessions , linked to the"
4710,exquisite lace-making of the past .
4711,But lace-making is by no means a lost
4712,art . It suffered a decline and fell into
4713,lamentably low standards in the fussy
4714,over-furnishing of the Victorian age
4715,but it would take more than a temporary
4716,"lapse in good taste to destroy this lovely ,"
4717,"viable craft . It has , in fact , readily"
4718,adapted itself to modern tastes and the ill-
4719,ustrations in the following pages will show
4720,how completely it is in sympathy with con-
4721,temporary surroundings .
4722,"It will be seen how , with bold design"
4723,"and rich colour , knitting , crochet and"
4724,tatting in fine and medium-weight cottons
4725,can give striking individuality to many things
4726,"in the home . Chairbacks , cushions , tablecloths ,"
4727,to mention only three - how satisfying it is
4728,to avoid the ready-made in these and by
4729,one's own handiwork produce something
4730,that reflects true creative talent .
4731,The more delicate patterns and finer
4732,threads may be reserved to bring a light
4733,and lovely touch to personal possessions -
4734,"a lace border to a handkerchief , fine-lace"
4735,"insertion on a petticoat or blouse , a tatted edge"
4736,"to a collar ; these add a charming , feminine"
4737,distinction that nothing else can give .
4738,Although we assess lace-making as one of
4739,"the feminine skills , a number of the well-loved"
4740,"traditional patterns that we follow today were ,"
4741,"in fact , the brain-children of inventive men ."
4742,"For in the old order of things , men designed"
4743,and worked lace as well as women and
4744,special schools were set up to teach lace-
4745,"making not only to young girls , but to little"
4746,boys as well . Whole families made their
4747,livelihood by lace-making and consequently
4748,"a folklore of song , festival and courtship grew"
4749,up around the lace industry .
4750,During the sixteenth century a considerable
4751,amount of crochet was produced in the
4752,convents of Europe . Without doubt it was the
4753,nuns who carried the craft to Ireland . There it
4754,was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive
4755,"form with rosettes , leaves and lace fillings . During"
4756,the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
4757,greatly abused .
4758,One can remember with horror the pictures of the
4759,overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
4760,"complete with heavy crochet antimacassars , mantel-"
4761,piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
4762,numerous other crocheted pieces . It was some years
4763,after the Victorian period that designers realised
4764,"the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was"
4765,revived with designs suitable for contemporary
4766,"trends . Crochet today has a variety of uses , and"
4767,has even stepped into the field of high fashion .
4768,In some of the elegant boutiques of Paris
4769,"hand-crocheted blouses , gossamer fine in"
4770,"texture , are sold at a very high price . With a"
4771,little time and concentration the woman at home can
4772,produce fashion articles as elegant as those of
4773,"Paris - a blouse , delicate gloves or a fine"
4774,"edging for collar , cuffs or a handkerchief ."
4775,"In the home , crochet lace can be used to make"
4776,"tablecloths , traycloths and runners , and edgings"
4777,from heavy to fine can fulfil a variety of
4778,functions . The art of crochet is not difficult and
4779,it is reasonably quick to work . In the following
4780,pages simple diagrams and instructions are given
4781,to enable the beginner to master all the essential
4782,crochet stitches .
4783,First launder crochet and then pin to the required
4784,"shape , ensuring that all lines of the crochet are"
4785,accurate . Place crochet in correct position on linen and
4786,secure with pins . Run a line of basting stitches
4787,on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges
4788,which are to be attached to the linen . Remove crochet .
4789,Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen :
4790,"( a ) Button Stitch round the outline of basting stitches ,"
4791,the knotted part of the button stitch lying on the
4792,outside edge . Oversew crochet to button stitch .
4793,"( b ) Turn under a small hem , with fold lying on line"
4794,of basting stitches . Work a row of dc all round
4795,"this hem , with 3 dc at each corner ."
4796,"Oversew crochet to the dc. A household word ,"
4797,Coats Mercer-Crochet possesses qualities which
4798,are of the utmost importance to the worker .
4799,"It washes beautifully , never loses its colour"
4800,"nor becomes ' stringy ' , is very elastic and"
4801,preserves the beauty of the design . It is easy
4802,"to work with , soft , glossy and of uniform"
4803,thickness - it is the ideal crochet thread .
4804,Remember that texture plays an important part in
4805,the beauty of crochet . The finer mercerised threads
4806,are more effective for the delicate designs used for
4807,"tablecloths , doilies , edgings and accessories , while"
4808,"the heavier threads are used for bedspreads ,"
4809,"chairbacks , luncheon mats , etc. Crochet hooks"
4810,"are made of steel , composition or bone . Steel"
4811,"crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0 ,"
4812,"the largest , to number 8 , the smallest ."
4813,Each size of hook is made for use with a certain
4814,"size of thread . To ensure the correct results ,"
4815,it is important that you use the size of hook
4816,specified in the directions . These are the
4817,correct numbers to use with Mercer-Crochet :
4818,Directions are given for a small practice
4819,piece for each stitch that you learn . When
4820,you have become proficient in these
4821,"stitches , attractive articles can be made"
4822,from the directions included in this book .
4823,1 . Grasp thread near end between thumb
4824,and forefinger . 2 . Make a loop by
4825,lapping long thread over short thread .
4826,3 . Hold loop in place between thumb
4827,and forefinger ( Fig. 1 ) . 1 . Take hold
4828,of broad bar of hook as you would a
4829,pencil . Bring middle finger forward to
4830,rest near tip of hook .
4831,2 . Insert hook through loop and under long
4832,thread . Catch long end of thread ( Fig. 2 ) .
4833,Draw loop through . 3 . Do not remove hook
4834,from thread . Pull short end and ball thread
4835,in opposite directions to bring loop close around
4836,"the end of the hook , but not too tight"
4837,"( Fig. 3 ) . Loop thread round little finger ,"
4838,across palm and behind forefinger ( Fig. 4 ) .
4839,A great deal of modern furniture has tapered
4840,"legs , and in reproduction period pieces they"
4841,are frequently used . The simpler varieties are
4842,"extremely easy to work , the four sides being"
4843,simply planed to give the required taper . In
4844,"the more elaborate varieties , however , a toe is"
4845,"worked in the solid , and this certainly"
4846,complicates the operation .
4847,For short ones a smoothing plane can be used .
4848,The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers
4849,"on the newly planed surfaces , and these treated"
4850,as before . It is unnecessary to mark the taper with
4851,the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth
4852,of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces
4853,straight .
4854,A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom
4855,end reveals when the required amount
4856,"has been removed , and if care is taken"
4857,to stop the plane short of the squared
4858,"pencil line at the top , the work will be"
4859,accurate . The straight-edge can be used
4860,to test the straightness of the sides .
4861,"Incidentally , it is better to"
4862,complete any mortising that may be
4863,needed at the top before the tapering is
4864,begun . Some plain tapered legs have
4865,"the taper on the two inner faces only ,"
4866,the outer surfaces being vertical as
4867,"at ( B ) , Fig. 1 . To make a leg such as"
4868,"that at ( D ) , Fig. 1 , the square is first"
4869,"marked out as at ( A ) , Fig. 3 ."
4870,Note that squared lines marking
4871,the top member of the toe are
4872,needed as well as the upper ex-
4873,"tent of the taper , and in"
4874,this case it is necessary to
4875,mark in the line of the taper
4876,with pencil and straight-edge
4877,"as at ( B ) , Fig. 3 . A saw cut is"
4878,made at the upper toe line
4879,"exactly down to the taper line ,"
4880,no farther .
4881,"But why woodwork in particular ? Well , there"
4882,are many reasons . Wood is in good and
4883,common supply ; it lends itself to making
4884,innumerable useful household items -
4885,"furniture , fitments , garden items , toys , etc. ;"
4886,it enables results to be obtained fairly
4887,quickly ; it is less expensive than most
4888,other materials ; it is a pleasant material
4889,"to work with ; and , although it does"
4890,"create a certain amount of mess , it is"
4891,all clean and easily cleared away .
4892,This last point is certainly important because almost
4893,everyone has come to recognise that machines
4894,"are not only an economic necessity , but that a"
4895,great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
4896,installation of a power tool . As an elementary
4897,"example , surely no one can pretend to enjoy"
4898,ripping out parts from hardwood . Most men
4899,would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
4900,were available .
4901,"Coming now to the actual tools and their cost , we begin"
4902,with what we have called a bare minimum kit . Probably
4903,most men have some of the tools already . It will enable
4904,"a man to make simple , straight-forward things , and in"
4905,any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
4906,which other tools can be added as the need arises . The
4907,nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
4908,"to be made , but as a guide we have given a fuller kit"
4909,which increases the range of things that can be
4910,made enormously .
4911,"As a still further development , we follow"
4912,"with a good basic kit , which includes"
4913,"the fuller kit ( which in its turn , of course ,"
4914,includes the bare minimum kit ) .
4915,With this the vast majority of jobs
4916,"can be done , though for advanced"
4917,cabinet work the necessity for
4918,certain special tools will become
4919,obvious .
4920,"Lastly , we suggest certain power tools and"
4921,"machines , the choice of which will"
4922,depend partly upon the space available
4923,"in the workshop , the amount one"
4924,"is prepared to pay , and the type of"
4925,"work a man normally does . First ,"
4926,"however , a word of advice generally ."
4927,Do not buy so-called cheap tools or
4928,machines . They never are cheap in the
4929,"long run . They may be inaccurate ,"
4930,"Most tools have to lead an intensive life , and faults"
4931,in design or quality soon become apparent . It is far
4932,better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
4933,"quality , and not handicap yourself from the start ."
4934,"To put it in a slightly different way , do not allow"
4935,yourself to blame the tools when the job does
4936,not turn out quite right !
4937,Many men with only limited accommodation
4938,have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table .
4939,"Providing this is sound , some perfectly good"
4940,"work can be done on it , but the usual problems"
4941,"are those of the vice , the bench stop , and storage"
4942,place for tools . The combined bench top and
4943,tool cupboard shown here has been specially
4944,designed and made for WOODWORKER
4945,readers who have this difficulty .
4946,HERE is a project that will be welcomed by the
4947,family man or father-to-be . Unlike many
4948,"commercial articles , this chair is solidly built and"
4949,capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the
4950,most destructive youngster . Almost any available
4951,timber can be used but Parana pine is
4952,"recommended , being cheap , easy to work , and"
4953,taking a good finish .
4954,Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed
4955,timber as shown in Fig. 1 . Although the timber will have already
4956,"been machine planed , remember to go over each piece with"
4957,"a smoothing plane , otherwise the marks left by the cutters"
4958,will show up after painting . The dimensions given enable the
4959,"feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table , but the height"
4960,can be altered if required .
4961,"All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned ,"
4962,which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat
4963,appearance . The side frames are joined by four cross pieces
4964,"each 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. by 14 in. which fit into the recesses ( C ) ,"
4965,cut to fit them .
4966,See Fig. 2 . These are then glued and
4967,pinned into place . A similar piece of 1 in.
4968,by 1 1/4 in. by 14 in. timber is fixed across
4969,the end of the feeding tray as seen in
4970,Fig. 3 which also shows how a piece of
4971,hardboard is covered with plastic material
4972,for easy cleaning and then fixed underneath
4973,the frame with panel pins to complete
4974,the feeding tray .
4975,Cut this piece of hardboard so that it
4976,fits up against the front legs of the
4977,chair . The seat rests across the upper two
4978,cross pieces and is made of 1/2 in. plywood
4979,"glued and panel pinned in position , measurements"
4980,being taken directly from the work . Fig. 4
4981,shows the framework for the back which
4982,is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber .
4983,The amount of the backward tilt and
4984,also the height is left to personal choice
4985,and the width is best taken directly
4986,from the work to ensure a good fit .
4987,Fix the piece A to the sides first
4988,with glue and panel pins and then fit
4989,the frame together with the piece
4990,B temporarily in place on the chair
4991,frame .
4992,"Decide on the required angle of slope ,"
4993,"keeping B flat on the chair seat , and mark"
4994,off the exact position of B on the side
4995,pieces . These can then be cut at the correct
4996,angle and B is glued and nailed in place .
4997,A piece of hardboard is then cut and pinned
4998,to the frame and its edges planed off
4999,flush .
5000,Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with
5001,screws driven from the inside . The footrest is a
5002,piece of timber 14 in. long and about 1/2 in.
5003,by 4 in. attached to the front legs with a pair
5004,of angle irons as shown in Fig. 5 . When determining
5005,"the position of the footrest , do not place too near"
5006,the seat to allow for the growth of baby's legs .
5007,"To complete the job , screw two fittings to the"
5008,inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the
5009,back to hold the baby's safety harness . These can be
5010,made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout
5011,wire as shown in Fig. 6 . Make sure that these
5012,are well secured as they will have to withstand
5013,considerable pulling as the child becomes older .
5014,Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes
5015,with plastic wood . Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole
5016,framework and round off any sharp edges ( such as the
5017,"edge of the seat , feeding tray , etc ) . Fill the grain with a"
5018,woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in
5019,"a suitable pastel shade , using a contrasting colour"
5020,for the seat and the back which can be decorated with
5021,a suitable nursery transfer .
5022,Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous
5023,"if junior decides to bite the chair . Finally , it is as well"
5024,to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective
5025,material that might be available as otherwise the
5026,paint would soon be scratched off .
5027,( J.H.P. ) BUILDING your own boat is a most
5028,satisfying and worthwhile project .
5029,Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
5030,rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
5031,sold . It is especially designed for simplicity in
5032,"construction , cheapness and lightness of weight ,"
5033,and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She
5034,weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
5035,and an outboard motor with a comfortable
5036,margin of freeboard .
5037,"For instance , in Canada we use galvanised nails"
5038,in place of screws . We just bend them over and clamp
5039,firmly by using a hammer on each side . Over here I 've
5040,"always used brass screws , which are more expensive . The first"
5041,"job is to make your moulds . In Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply ,"
5042,"but to save money any scrap may be used , and if this"
5043,"is nailed and glued together strongly , it may be marked"
5044,and cut to shape later .
5045,If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
5046,"the moulds , make a frame of rough lumber as shown in"
5047,Fig. 2 . The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
5048,"rigid as possible , for it is on these you will be building"
5049,"and shaping your little craft , upside-down . For cheapness"
5050,I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
5051,Columbia .
5052,This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure
5053,a permanently water proof glue line . Be sure to
5054,"see that the edge bears the mark , P.M.B.C. Exterior ."
5055,This may be bought at any good timber merchants .
5056,The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply
5057,"wood of the same make , or oak or mahogany . For the"
5058,"last one I made , I used the two flaps from an old"
5059,mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one
5060,shilling .
5061,I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
5062,"rowing this dinghy ( Fig. 3 ) . They are very simple , cheap"
5063,and easy to make . As will be seen from the plan
5064,there is only a single gunwale on the outside .
5065,I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada
5066,is difficult to obtain here and expensive . I overcome
5067,this in another way as shown in Fig. 4 .
5068,Cut the moulds and the
5069,transoms to shape as in the
5070,detailed drawings . If you have
5071,a wooden floor you can use
5072,' A ' frames fastened to the floor
5073,"if not , use a strong horizontal"
5074,frame that will sit firmly on
5075,the ground or concrete floor . I
5076,use a heavy old base as in
5077,Fig. 2 .
5078,The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to
5079,correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat .
5080,Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould
5081,to allow for the chines to rest in these
5082,"notches , as they are not fastened to the"
5083,"moulds , which will only be used whilst"
5084,the hull is under construction .
5085,The chine is the long stringer on each side which
5086,is joined to both transoms and lies in the grooves
5087,"cut in the moulds . Each chine is made of oak ,"
5088,"ash , spruce or any long grained flexible wood . I"
5089,prefer spruce when available . As will be seen
5090,"in the plan , the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in."
5091,on each side .
5092,The chines are morticed into this and butt up
5093,against the transom . Start at the bow and
5094,spring them both at the same time over the
5095,slots cut in the moulds and into the notches
5096,cut for this purpose in the stern or after
5097,"transom framing . Glue , screw and make fast ."
5098,"The skeleton of the boat will now take shape ,"
5099,and this is the time to check before making fast
5100,to see that nothing is distorted . Ensure that
5101,the outside measurements from transom to transom
5102,are equal on each side and that the transoms
5103,are parallel horizontally . Next bevel the chines
5104,with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly .
5105,Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
5106,plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
5107,planing after fixing to the boat . Use your two
5108,lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this
5109,"purpose , the sides from one , and the bottom from"
5110,the other . If care is taken not to waste the
5111,"ply , plenty of material is left over for the thwarts ."
5112,"Having trimmed up the chines , we are now ready"
5113,"to plank the sides . Start again at the bows ,"
5114,clamping into position with a ' D ' clamp . Bend
5115,round the frame to the stern and clamp there . If
5116,you have a third clamp use it in the centre as
5117,"well . After generously covering with glue , screw"
5118,the sides to the transom framing and the chine .
5119,Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws ( brass ) or nail
5120,"with inch and a quarter galvanized nails , if"
5121,you are doing it that way . Use flat head screws
5122,about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in
5123,the 1/4 in. ply . Make a very small hole for
5124,the screw to allow for a good grip . Remember
5125,to glue before screwing .
5126,"Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom ,"
5127,which is cut in one piece . It should overlap just a
5128,trifle ; this can be cleaned up later . As you are
5129,screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
5130,necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
5131,the screws . I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
5132,"the bottom , both for screwing to the chines and"
5133,the bottom shaped transom facing .
5134,"Again , don't forget to glue . Now put on the keel and"
5135,the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off
5136,"the moulds . You won't want them again for this boat , so"
5137,shift them right out of the way . Place the boat right side
5138,up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for
5139,working .
5140,Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts ( seats )
5141,taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats
5142,with vertical members as shown in the plans . Make the
5143,four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions
5144,before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put
5145,a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside ( gunwale )
5146,one to fit the block .
5147,I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull
5148,with copper nails and roves . It greatly improves the
5149,"appearance and the strength . Paint with good marine primer ,"
5150,undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint .
5151,WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut
5152,into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either
5153,making fabric pictures or designs .
5154,While these may ultimately be made into a picture
5155,"for framing and hanging on a wall , they may"
5156,"also be arranged into a design , and the"
5157,resulting panel utilized for decorating a useful
5158,article .
5159,This could hardly happen without the
5160,herring having some orientation with the
5161,sea bottom . It means that the crowding
5162,"is caused during the daytime , and that"
5163,the herring must continue to migrate over
5164,the ground as well as in midwater and
5165,during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia
5166,is always from the north ) .
5167,Thus we can see that herring
5168,"movements , although primarily"
5169,"instinctive perhaps , and certainly"
5170,"helped and hindered by water flow ,"
5171,are also closely related to the sea-bed
5172,"geography . Geography , too , names the"
5173,great fisheries that depend on them :
5174,the Fladen Ground ( where again most big
5175,"shots are taken on the edges ) , the Gut ,"
5176,a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
5177,the herring spawn along the northern
5178,The effect of bottom congestion due to
5179,the light pressure is inevitably mixed
5180,with that of the suitability of ground
5181,"for spawning . Both result in crowding ,"
5182,so there is no need to try to separate
5183,them - thank Heaven ! A good picture of
5184,this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
5185,grounds from the Viking in the north down
5186,to the Klondykes and the Reef along
5187,the western edge of the Norwegian
5188,Deep .
5189,In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom .
5190,Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure . But
5191,"they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until"
5192,in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
5193,echo-sounders . Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
5194,their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable
5195,gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
5196,spawning herring are always found .
5197,The joint evidence of echo-sounders
5198,and fishing gear leads to an overall
5199,though somewhat dim picture .
5200,The details are harder still to see .
5201,"Drift Effects . At East Anglia , for instance ,"
5202,shoals that gather at the Knoll or
5203,other banks are most of them
5204,going to travel a hundred
5205,miles farther south before they
5206,spawn . Some will spawn at the
5207,So the arrival of any particular shoal
5208,fish at a certain spawning ground may
5209,be accidental . Yet there will always be some
5210,"that find it if enough are travelling , just as"
5211,the robin who gets back exactly may be
5212,only one among thousands who do not .
5213,But this southerly migration is not
5214,accidental . Being contranatant or against
5215,"the drift , it probably has a survival value"
5216,in ensuring that the fry after hatching
5217,are drifted back into the normal home
5218,Drift in another form probably
5219,explains how these migrating herring
5220,are biased to east or west by the
5221,different winds . Strong westerlies
5222,are well known to bring good
5223,longshore fishings . The surface
5224,water that is blown offshore must
5225,be replaced by an underflow bringing
5226,with it the herring to the Norfolk
5227,and Suffolk beaches .
5228,"Easterly winds , on the other hand ,"
5229,"mean no herring along the shore , as"
5230,recent years have shown . A succession
5231,of winds is needed for this effect of
5232,"course - one breeze will not do it ,"
5233,though a very hard westerly will
5234,"often start off the "" local "" herring ;"
5235,but quite apart from this wind effect
5236,there is an easterly drift special
5237,"to this rump of coastline , caused by"
5238,the meeting of water from north and south .
5239,"Herring fishermen call this "" the outset "" . It"
5240,"is strongest at spring tides , when without"
5241,"wind you will "" set "" out - or drift to the east-"
5242,"ward , the length of half a fleet of nets -"
5243,almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
5244,Knoll . Without an explanation of how it
5245,"works , it may well be that this outset , akin"
5246,"to the mouth of a great salmon river , has"
5247,been the biggest factor through the ages
5248,in the constancy of this great herring fishery .
5249,The East Anglian behaviour ( see p. 82 )
5250,has always differed from that of the
5251,"summer fisheries . There is the "" swim """
5252,"at slack waters , even in daylight"
5253,"sometimes ; and the high swimming ,"
5254,when fish are caught only in the top
5255,few yards of netting . These and other
5256,fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar
5257,"to this fishery , which unfortunately seems"
5258,to be dying out ; but a full discussion of
5259,them is beyond the present scope .
5260,The Bow-wave Theory . This assumes
5261,"that all fishing gear , when moving ,"
5262,"sends before it a kind of scaring effect ,"
5263,probably through waves or vibrations in
5264,the water or along the ground .
5265,Underwater films suggest that the
5266,footrope of a trawl does this . Films
5267,have also shown plaice moving before
5268,a seine net in just the same way after
5269,being gathered inwards by the ropes .
5270,( Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved ; it may
5271,"be by actual contact , or by sight reaction to the disturbed"
5272,"sand ; or even in the case of flat fish , by vibrations"
5273,through or along the bottom . ) But given such a bow
5274,"wave of disturbance , it is obvious that without something"
5275,"to overcome its effect , very few fish would be caught ."
5276,Let us consider first what would
5277,appear to be the simplest case -
5278,that of flat fish on the bottom .
5279,The evidence suggest that the fish are
5280,aware of the moving footrope before
5281,it reaches them . They move away before
5282,"it , swimming at the same speed"
5283,"for an unknown period of time , until"
5284,"they become ( 1 ) tired , or ( 2 ) more used"
5285,to the disturbance .
5286,Then they stop swimming and are caught . In
5287,the seine-net film this usually seemed to
5288,happen just after the fish had risen above
5289,"the footrope , and presumably out of its"
5290,"field of disturbance , or bow wave . This suggests"
5291,that the wave might be transmitted by the
5292,"sea-bed , though the footrope in this case"
5293,was actually just off the bottom and was
5294,indeed passing over some fish .
5295,Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
5296,And in this film the rise of the fish was
5297,"small , a matter of a foot or two . With round"
5298,"fish like haddock , which would hardly"
5299,"find safety on the bottom , this cover"
5300,would seem to be even more essential ;
5301,but more films are needed to prove this .
5302,Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
5303,essential to catch round fish whose
5304,reaction to disturbance would be upwards .
5305,WE have not yet reached the stage in Britain
5306,"when 50 planes are engaged in spreading 1,500 tons"
5307,of DDT and fuel oil over 3 million acres or when
5308,20 million acres are sprayed with dieldrin . An eye-
5309,witness described one sprayed area as literally rank with
5310,the stench of small game and birds dead from insecti-
5311,cide poisoning .
5312,"Wholesale chemical spraying , upsetting as it"
5313,does the balance of nature by killing both pests
5314,"and predators , is viewed with concern by a"
5315,number of American State Research Stations . Not
5316,content with issuing bulletins on the dangers
5317,"of the misuse of chemicals in agriculture ,"
5318,some stations are carrying out useful research on
5319,pest control by biological means . Both native and
5320,imported predatory insects and insect pathogens
5321,are used in field trial tests .
5322,The biological control of pests in the garden
5323,is not new to the American gardener . Lady-
5324,"birds figure in press advertisements , their"
5325,sale being by the gallon . Praying mantis ( Mantis
5326,"religiosa ) , both native and "" immigrant "" varieties ,"
5327,are used by gardeners in all parts of the United
5328,"States . Advertisements offer eggs of European ,"
5329,Chinese or native forms of mantis .
5330,From the day it hatches in the spring
5331,"until it dies in the late autumn , the"
5332,praying mantis satisfies its voracity by
5333,eating other insects . Nine blowflies
5334,may be consumed at one sitting and
5335,"the fully adult , 2 1/2-in.-long insect ,"
5336,is able to keep a firm hold on one
5337,grasshopper while eating another .
5338,"According to Dr. Max Beier in "" Fang-"
5339,"heuschrecken "" ( Die Neue Brehm Bu""ckerei ,"
5340,"1952 ) , the praying mantis is trecking"
5341,northwards .
5342,Meanwhile Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an
5343,egg-case of the Chinese mantis . The
5344,first mantis had hatched from the very large
5345,egg-case on June 6 . Both the Chinese
5346,"and Spanish mantis , in the young stage"
5347,"at any rate , are light brown in colour ."
5348,"Because of the cool , wet weather , I had great"
5349,"difficulty in breeding fruit flies and , after"
5350,many of the mantis of both types had died
5351,"in my Kilner jars , I poured living mantis"
5352,over vines and peachtrees .
5353,A Gardeners Chronicle reader living in
5354,"Grantham , Lincs , kindly offered to"
5355,cooperate with me in studying praying
5356,mantis as a pest control in the cold
5357,greenhouse . Of the dozen Spanish mantis
5358,"sent him by post on June 22 , only two or"
5359,three survived the journey ; one thrived
5360,and the latest report I have is that
5361,this mantis is still alive .
5362,DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes
5363,"since the end of the war , clay pots are"
5364,still in greatest demand . It is mostly
5365,in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
5366,"have made headway , and although"
5367,numerous small clay pots are used each
5368,"year , they are fewer than they were 10"
5369,years ago . In the larger sizes there is still
5370,no real substitute for clay that can be
5371,"obtained at a comparable price , except the"
5372,bituminized paper pots which are used on
5373,commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
5374,The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
5375,brittle nature ; even with reasonably careful
5376,"handling , the annual losses are often around"
5377,"10 per cent. , and where the handling and"
5378,"storage facilities are not too good , these"
5379,losses will be even greater . This does not
5380,"necessarily apply to the larger sizes , as"
5381,they are not quite so fragile as the
5382,smaller ones and are not normally thrown
5383,about in quite the same way .
5384,The storage problem puts clay pots at a
5385,definite disadvantage . They are fairly heavy
5386,and difficult things to accommodate and
5387,they must have some protection from severe
5388,"weather , which can be quite a headache in"
5389,a small garden . While admitting that
5390,broken pots have on occasions provided
5391,"artists with delightful studies , there is no"
5392,"doubt that a pile of badly stacked ,"
5393,half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
5394,from any point of view .
5395,Every garden boy will agree that having to
5396,wash clay pots is a definite factor in
5397,favour of their abolition ; in fact one
5398,young man was so wholehearted about this
5399,a few years ago that he made the headlines
5400,for having smashed a large number # to
5401,relieve his feelings . On the small-to-medium
5402,"establishment , it is a disagreeable chore"
5403,"which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm ,"
5404,whereas on larger establishments the pots
5405,can be sterilized or washed by machine .
5406,It is not easy to make an economic
5407,comparison between clay pots and the various
5408,substitutes ; the former may last indefinitely
5409,"with luck , while the latter are often"
5410,expendable used only once . Clay pots are
5411,efficient and congenial containers in which
5412,to grow plants . In their proper setting they
5413,"are not unattractive and , in spite of"
5414,"their shortcomings , most gardeners have"
5415,a nostalgic affection for them .
5416,"Present-day pots are better finished , do"
5417,not get dirty so readily and are easier to
5418,wash . The deep rims make for neater and
5419,"safer stacking , though they are still"
5420,expensive and still get broken . On the
5421,"other hand , there is really no replacement"
5422,"for the larger sizes , so they have the"
5423,decided advantage of being the only
5424,suitable container available in quantity
5425,for fairly large plants .
5426,Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
5427,pots for plant raising . These are compressed blocks of
5428,"compost , made in a specially devised press to"
5429,simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot .
5430,"Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape , they"
5431,are made of the same compost as would have
5432,"been used in a pot , the # only difference being"
5433,that it is used in a slightly moister
5434,condition .
5435,"Seed is sown , or seedlings are pricked out into them"
5436,"in the normal way , the only real difference"
5437,being that more of the watering is done through a
5438,rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
5439,"of water . First-class plants of tomatoes ,"
5440,"cucumbers , marrows , melons , cauliflowers ,"
5441,"celery and onions , may all be raised in soil"
5442,blocks ; so can such flowering plants as
5443,"dahlias , chrysanthemums , salvias , sweet peas ,"
5444,lupins and numerous others .
5445,One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
5446,one : the cost of a pot of any description is saved
5447,completely . Manufacturing the block and planting
5448,"it is very little more trouble than normal potting ,"
5449,"and a superior plant , which transplants more"
5450,"easily , is produced . The obvious limitation #"
5451,is that soil blocks can only be used for
5452,propagating ; there can be no progression to a
5453,larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
5454,to be moved ; it must be planted out or
5455,potted .
5456,Many amateur gardeners might improve their
5457,results by buying a small hand-operated soil
5458,block maker and use the money saved on
5459,buying small pots to improve their composts .
5460,The various types of small paper pots are very
5461,"useful for short-term operations , but are"
5462,inclined to collapse if the plants are in them
5463,too long .
5464,They are # quite useful for plants that are
5465,"despatched to market or direct to customers ,"
5466,their cheapness making them attractive to the
5467,nurseryman ; there is also considerable saving
5468,in carriage costs because of their lightness .
5469,There are many types of plastic pots available ;
5470,"some expensive , some quite cheap ; some good"
5471,and others not so good . A wide range of
5472,plants grow quite well in plastic pots and
5473,usually need less water than those in clay
5474,pots .
5475,They are slightly more difficult to
5476,"manage , however , until a little experience"
5477,has been gained with them . Plastic pots
5478,"are usually more expensive than clay ones ,"
5479,but they are almost indestructible and
5480,will last a long time with normal care .
5481,The job of the teacher is to set the learner's
5482,vocabulary to work on the existing store
5483,so as to make it grow . He does not
5484,simply pack new things into the store .
5485,The solitary learner has to find out
5486,"how to do this for himself , with the help"
5487,of books . He uses his vocabulary to
5488,ask questions and uses the books to
5489,find the answers .
5490,Thus learning how to learn means becoming
5491,"your own philosopher , your own psychologist"
5492,and your own teacher . You will then be
5493,a well-established learner and the world
5494,will be at your feet . Although the word
5495,""" mind "" has given rise to endless"
5496,controversy among philosophers and psycho-
5497,"logists , many of whom would like to"
5498,"abolish it from the dictionary , most"
5499,of us obstinately go on using it .
5500,And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of
5501,""" mind "" vanishes , at any rate for some time . It seems very difficult"
5502,"to detach the mind from the brain , and all the biological ,"
5503,surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very
5504,close connection . There is a lot to be said for keeping the
5505,"word "" soul "" to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable"
5506,essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from
5507,"the body , and to reserve the more prosaic word "" mind "" for"
5508,the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which
5509,are clearly associated with the brain .
5510,Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
5511,"picture of this "" basis "" of mental phenomena ?"
5512,"The physicists have succeeded remarkably well ,"
5513,"with the atomic theory , in giving a clear and detailed"
5514,picture of the basis of such material phenomena
5515,"as chemical action , magnetism , the behaviour of"
5516,gases and so on . Where has psychology got to in its
5517,"theories of "" mind "" ? Are there any ultimate units"
5518,of mind akin to the atoms of matter ?
5519,At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
5520,be analysed into discrete bits . These bits were
5521,identified as elementary sensations . These were
5522,thought to combine together to form compound
5523,experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
5524,matter combine to form molecular compounds .
5525,But this view led to too many difficulties and
5526,was finally abandoned . Nevertheless the search
5527,for basic units of mind has gone on and will
5528,"doubtless continue , for it is the aim of science to"
5529,discover ultimate units .
5530,"We must beware , however , of supposing that there must be any"
5531,close analogy between the units of quite different
5532,sciences . For example the success of the atomic theory
5533,in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
5534,units of geometry must be points . It would be more
5535,correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of
5536,geometry .
5537,There have been many conflicting tendencies in
5538,psychology in its search for ultimate units and here
5539,we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising
5540,concept which is current today . It is known as the schema .
5541,It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it
5542,concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification
5543,but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction .
5544,It is the tendency to get things
5545,the wrong way round . As a
5546,psychologist I am constantly
5547,encountering this tendency
5548,in friends and acquaintances .
5549,They think there is something
5550,"inevitably "" queer "" about psychology"
5551,and this feeling of queerness
5552,usually boils down to a quite
5553,mistaken belief that the
5554,psychologist first looks into ...
5555,"This is what I mean by "" getting things the wrong way"
5556,"round "" . He is far more likely to find out about how"
5557,his own mind works by looking at other people's .
5558,"For although looking inwards ( or "" introspecting """
5559,"as it is called ) , is not entirely ruled out ,"
5560,nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is
5561,one of the most unreliable methods of getting
5562,any precise information .
5563,And so they prefer objective methods . Since they cannot
5564,directly look into the mental processes of another
5565,person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
5566,to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
5567,this behaviour . This is no more queer than the method
5568,"of the doctor who observes signs , and records symptoms ,"
5569,and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them .
5570,He may never have had the disease himself but he
5571,can nevertheless identify it . Similarly the psychologist has
5572,to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
5573,"all kinds of processes in other people , whether or not they"
5574,correspond with anything in his own experience . We know
5575,very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
5576,"provide our schemas , nor do we need to know as far as"
5577,psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of
5578,the neuro-physiologists .
5579,"The numerically largest group , consisting of male"
5580,weekly wage-earners up to chargehand level
5581,"and in the works only , excluding the offices , was"
5582,therefore selected . A detailed age-structure was
5583,"compiled from personnel department records ,"
5584,revealing that there were ( at that time ) seven-
5585,"teen men seventy years of age or older ,"
5586,"thirty-three aged sixty-four years , and sixty-"
5587,five just fifty years of age .
5588,"A small panel was formed , not on a formally representative"
5589,"basis but rather of energetic and concerned individuals ,"
5590,from various levels in the firm . In due course
5591,the panel decided to seek further insight into the
5592,"problems faced by older workers , and approached"
5593,those seventy years of age or older .
5594,"The Rubery , Owen scheme is now in its"
5595,"fourth year , and opportunity has been taken"
5596,to revise the course in the light of
5597,experience . Topics for the six weekly meetings
5598,of one-and-a-half hours ( each held half in
5599,"company time , half in the man's time ) are"
5600,now as follows : 1 . Personal adjustment 2 . Health
5601,3 . Work and leisure 4 . Living arrangements
5602,5 . Financial planning 6 . Final discussion
5603,"The weekend conference for the men and their wives ,"
5604,which takes place at company expense in a country or
5605,"resort hotel , includes an address on ' The Woman's Point"
5606,of View ' and one on ' Making the Most of Health ' . Separate
5607,discussions are arranged for the wives in addition to the
5608,plenary sessions . Of the men reaching fifty years of age
5609,"since the scheme started , 125 ( 37.2 per cent ) have"
5610,taken part .
5611,The original scheme was planned to provide short re-
5612,fresher courses at the ages of fifty-five and sixty :
5613,"the first of these is due in 1963 . Meanwhile , each"
5614,' graduate ' is encouraged to seek help and advice in
5615,"working out his ideas , either through the company's"
5616,personnel department or by an approach to
5617,members of the panel responsible for the scheme .
5618,The latter do not regard themselves as expert
5619,"advisers , but are prepared to seek out the"
5620,appropriate sources of information or advice .
5621,"Towards the end of 1956 , Mr. Daniel Grant ,"
5622,an Employee Relations Officer of
5623,Rolls-Royce Ltd. and a member of the
5624,"Workers' Educational Association , submitted"
5625,"to the Lord Provost of Glasgow , Dr. Andrew"
5626,"Hood , a copy of his report on an enquiry"
5627,he had made into the problems that beset
5628,older workers and the effects of retirement
5629,Hugentobler Roger
5630,"The Lord Provost , having studied the report on ' The Morale and"
5631,"Health of Retired Workers ' , and being satisfied that the matters"
5632,raised were of considerable importance to the citizens of
5633,"Glasgow and warranted further study , set an informal"
5634,committee representative of bodies particularly concerned with
5635,the welfare of older people to examine the report and
5636,its implications and to consider the advisability of
5637,arranging a Conference on Preparation for and
5638,Occupational Activities on Retirement .
5639,The large attendance and atmosphere of
5640,"this Conference , held in October , 1957 ,"
5641,reflected not only an increasing awareness
5642,of the problems of men and women nearing
5643,or already in retirement but also a strong
5644,desire on the part of all concerned for
5645,concerted action towards preparing men
5646,and women for life in retirement and more
5647,adequate provision of facilities for
5648,"crafts , hobbies and leisure-time interests"
5649,for those who are retired .
5650,"As a result , the Glasgow Retirement Council came"
5651,"into being in April , 1958 , with Dr. Andrew Hood as"
5652,chairman and Mr. Andrew Atkinson as secretary . The
5653,Council has active committees on Education and
5654,"Preparation for Retirement , and on Occupational"
5655,Centres . The former consists of representatives from
5656,the Glasgow Corporation Further Education Department ;
5657,the Workers' Educational Association ; the University
5658,Extra-Mural Education Committee and departments
5659,"of psychology , education and social science ; ... ."
5660,"In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M. Banks , Assistant Director"
5661,"of Education for Glasgow , that industrial firms might be ready"
5662,to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation
5663,"for retirement , their wages paid for the time thus spent . An"
5664,approach was made to about twenty large firms and in Oc-
5665,"tober , 1959 , the first experimental day-release course for"
5666,men was organised . Eleven students from seven firms atten-
5667,ded a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both
5668,to the men and their employers that the venture was an
5669,experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much
5670,as the participants .
5671,1 . Are there differences in adjustment to ageing
5672,and retirement according to the occupational
5673,"level of employees ? 2 . If so , which occupational"
5674,levels are the better or the poorer prepared
5675,for successful adjustment to retirement and
5676,in what aspects ? 3 . Does the evidence
5677,obtained support a rationale for adapting
5678,a pre-retirement planning and preparation
5679,programme to the needs of older employees
5680,of different occupational levels ?
5681,Each time you rehearse you will probably put
5682,things in a different way . All the better ! - it will
5683,sound much more spontaneous on the occasion
5684,itself . Remember your four names - have the list
5685,with you if you like - and you simply can't
5686,"be flummoxed ! Of course , in any speech a good"
5687,start and a good finish are half the battle .
5688,"So - see the next page ! Yes , they are waiting for you ."
5689,But there is no need to be frightened . The audience
5690,will eat out of your hand - if they like what
5691,you offer them . A good start will put them in a
5692,good humour . Ladies and gentlemen ! I 'm afraid
5693,I have not had much experience of public speaking .
5694,But that 's a terrible way to begin ! Why tell them you
5695,are a novice ? It 's their interest you want - not their
5696,sympathy . And you want to get it from the word
5697,GO ! Try something like this : It is said that tele-
5698,"vision keeps people at home . But you , at any"
5699,"rate , have proved that wrong . And they say , too ,"
5700,that television makes its appeal to those of lesser
5701,intelligence .
5702,May I suggest that you have proved that
5703,right ! Congratulations ! And away you go into
5704,"your speech . Take some thought , too , for your ending ."
5705,Thank you for listening to me so patiently . A political
5706,candidate often used that finish . No wonder he
5707,didn't get in ! Instead he might have ended
5708,"this way : Well , those are my views ."
5709,When he learned what was causing the commotion he
5710,"became greatly alarmed , and after the body had been"
5711,taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his
5712,grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth
5713,"Camp , aged thirty-three , the girl who was to have"
5714,been his bride . There was little doubt of how
5715,"she had met her death , and even less that it"
5716,had been murder .
5717,She had been struck several times with a blunt
5718,"instrument , and her head was smashed in ."
5719,"There were signs of a violent struggle , blood"
5720,"on the cushions and floor , and the remains"
5721,of her broken umbrella . But a pair of bone
5722,cuff-links found in the compartment seemed
5723,to provide the only possible clue to the killer .
5724,"The body was examined , and it was definitely"
5725,established that no sexual assault had taken place .
5726,It seemed probable that the motive had been
5727,"robbery , and this was further confirmed when a"
5728,check was made with the woman's relations in
5729,Hounslow . Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
5730,"Good Intent , a public-house in Walworth . Her day"
5731,"off was Thursday , and before coming up to London"
5732,"in the evening she had called on her two sisters ,"
5733,one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
5734,"other at Hounslow , where she kept a shop ."
5735,"Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon ,"
5736,"and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M. , where"
5737,"she had tea with her other sister , and then"
5738,went to catch the 7.42 . Her sister saw her
5739,"to the station , helping her with some of"
5740,her packages . This sister was able to establish
5741,that she had carried a green purse and
5742,had bought a railway ticket .
5743,"But both purse and ticket , and the packages , were gone when the body"
5744,was found at Waterloo . Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it
5745,likely that she had been carrying much money . A porter at Hounslow
5746,supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her
5747,"compartment when the train left , but this did not help much , since it"
5748,had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo .
5749,The police began a systematic search of the line -
5750,"no easy task , but one in which patience and method"
5751,paid off . At a spot on the embankment between
5752,Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
5753,"pestle such as chemists use , with some hairs"
5754,"sticking to it . The murder weapon , more than likely ,"
5755,and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a
5756,killer to book in modern times .
5757,"But in 1897 , alas ! there was no fingerprint bureau ,"
5758,no experts to check and photograph any ' dabs ' it
5759,might have yielded . It was a tough case to
5760,"tackle , and Superintendent Robinson , of the L.S.W.R."
5761,"Police , and Chief Inspector Marshall , of Scotland"
5762,"Yard , combined forces in the investigation . While"
5763,accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been
5764,"attacked for the sake of robbery , they did not"
5765,overlook the possibility that this might have
5766,"disguised another motive , and a thorough check"
5767,of her former men friends and acquaintances began .
5768,"They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours , so-"
5769,"me well meant , some mischievous , including one that a"
5770,man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
5771,"the Thursday evening , with blood actually dripping from"
5772,"his hands . The inquest was opened on February 17 , but ,"
5773,beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
5774,the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
5775,"in which she had died , there was nothing on"
5776,"which to proceed , and the inquest was"
5777,adjourned .
5778,Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
5779,trails . It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
5780,"money to her relatives , and her brother-in-law was asked for"
5781,a detailed account of his movements on the 11th . The dead
5782,woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
5783,named Brown .
5784,This man agreed that his engagement had
5785,been broken off after one particular
5786,"tiff , but denied that he owed Miss Camp any"
5787,money . All the while the police were casting about
5788,for a man who had been seen leaving the train
5789,at Wandsworth . A passenger described this individual
5790,"as a man of about thirty , of medium height , with"
5791,"a dark moustache , and wearing a frockcoat"
5792,and a top-hat .
5793,The porter at the station bore out this
5794,"description , but the man was not traced ."
5795,"Perhaps the news of their search got around ,"
5796,for a man did obligingly present himself
5797,"at Wandsworth police-station , claiming to have"
5798,committed the murder - but he was mentally
5799,"defective , and , despite his claim to infamy ,"
5800,had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening .
5801,"Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body , which"
5802,"had at first been considered as belonging to the killer ,"
5803,"proved yet another red herring , for it was learned that"
5804,they had been borrowed by Elizabeth Camp from one
5805,of her sisters . A young man from Reading named Marshall
5806,had an uncomfortable time in the presence of the coroner .
5807,"This man was known to have left his home on February 11 , and"
5808,"to have been away for four days . Not in itself a crime , but , added to"
5809,the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guil-
5810,"dford for a false moustache , it left him with something to"
5811,explain . His story was that he had left home to try to
5812,join the Army ( presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance
5813,"his military bearing ) , and this was accepted ."
5814,"And so the inquest , which had dragged on , with"
5815,"adjournments , until April 7 , finally had to be content to return"
5816,"a verdict of "" wilful murder against some person or"
5817,"persons unknown . "" The most vital clue of the Wedgwood"
5818,pestle had been of no assistance . The killer must
5819,have been very thankful that the science of
5820,dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings .
5821,"The next female fatality occurred eight years later ,"
5822,yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
5823,a further seven years before even a ghost of a
5824,solution emerged . There has always been something
5825,sinister in the idea of tunnels . The building of
5826,them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
5827,nected with railway construction ; and there
5828,were many people who believed that to travel
5829,through tunnels would be an equally
5830,hazardous business .
5831,Some thought that the result would be all
5832,sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
5833,"confined atmosphere . "" The shareholders who travel"
5834,"by it will be so heartily sick , what with the"
5835,"foul air , smoke and sulphur , that the mention"
5836,"of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha , """
5837,wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
5838,proposed to build the Box Tunnel .
5839,The mere thought of subterranean travel
5840,gave others a feeling of danger . A medical journal
5841,"said , "" the deafening peal of thunder , the sudden"
5842,"immersion in gloom , and the clash of reverberated"
5843,sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
5844,"momentary shudder , or idea of destruction , a thrill"
5845,"of annihilation . "" It was also prophesied that"
5846,passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
5847,darkness .
5848,"For all that , as far as England is concerned ,"
5849,there have been only two occasions on
5850,which a body has been found in a tunnel
5851,in circumstances pointing to murder .
5852,"The first was that of Mr Gold , in the famous"
5853,"Lefroy case , and by an odd chance the second tragedy"
5854,"occurred on the same line , although this time the"
5855,victim was a woman .
5856,Though in the minds of most people there was
5857,no doubt that the woman had been the victim
5858,"of foul play , the verdict brought in was that there"
5859,was not sufficient evidence to show whether
5860,she had fallen or been thrown from a train .
5861,"The Merstham Tunnel , on the London-to-"
5862,"Brighton line , is approximately one mile long ,"
5863,and some time before midnight on September
5864,"24 , 1905 , a Sunday , Sub-Inspector Peacock , of"
5865,"the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway ,"
5866,It was the battered and broken body of a woman .
5867,He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
5868,"Station , and a stretcher party took the body to"
5869,the Feathers Hotel to await identification .
5870,"Was it a case of suicide , where some unhappy soul"
5871,had walked deliberately into the blackness and
5872,into the path of some train ? This hardly seemed
5873,"likely , since , when she was examined by a local"
5874,"doctor , the woman , young , small , and rather plump ,"
5875,was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
5876,"almost tight enough to strangle her , and the ends"
5877,thrust in her mouth like a gag .
5878,"Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising ,"
5879,and there were other injuries on her body which had
5880,occurred before her death was ensured by some
5881,train which had roared through the tunnel . There were
5882,no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
5883,"fication , no money , and no railway ticket . By then"
5884,reports were being gathered about all traffic over
5885,"this stretch of line , but no information was"
5886,forthcoming about any carriage with an open
5887,"door , nor any passenger reporting an incident"
5888,which might relate .
5889,So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
5890,long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
5891,remained a mystery until later the following day .
5892,During that time a description of the girl was
5893,"circulated , and a Mr Robert Money came forward to"
5894,"identify her as his sister , Mary Money , aged twenty-two ."
5895,"The girl , who was described as being "" always bright and"
5896,"jolly , "" had been unmarried , and lived at Lavender Hill ,"
5897,"Clapham , on the premises of a dairyman , Bridger , for"
5898,whom she worked as a book-keeper .
5899,"On the Sunday , the day of her death , she had gone out in the"
5900,"evening at about seven o'clock , telling her room-mate , Emma"
5901,"Hone , that she was going for a walk , but would not be"
5902,"gone for long . According to Miss Hone , she had not been"
5903,"carrying a handbag , but she believed she had had a small"
5904,purse .
5905,At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector
5906,was able to identify a photograph of the
5907,"girl , and he said he had last seen her"
5908,on platform six waiting to board
5909,a train for the short run to Victoria .
5910,A passenger at Victoria said he had seen
5911,"a young lady "" as near as possible """
5912,"like the photograph shown him , with"
5913,"a man "" very close in conversation and"
5914,"walking arm in arm . """
5915,A guard reported that at East Croydon
5916,he had seen what was accepted as the
5917,same couple sitting close together in
5918,a first-class compartment of the
5919,train from London Bridge of which
5920,he was in charge . The two could
5921,have joined this train by taking
5922,one from Victoria and changing
5923,at East Croydon . He also believed
5924,that they had still been together at
5925,"South Croydon , and he remembered"
5926,Medical evidence established that Mary
5927,Money had been dead for about an
5928,"hour before her body was discovered ,"
5929,and this matched reasonably well with
5930,the timetable of the train in question .
5931,More important evidence came from a
5932,"signalman at Purley Oaks , who had"
5933,"seen , as the train passed his box , a"
5934,couple struggling in a first-class
5935,compartment ; but he seemed to have
5936,been used to seeing couples engaged in
5937,SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
5938,told us that there was nothing an En-
5939,glishman would not do ; nothing an Ame-

5941,Italian would not sing ; no music
5942,to which the Frenchman would not
5943,dance ; nothing the German would
5944,not covet ; and nothing the Chinese
5945,would not eat .

5951,nothing the German would not covet ; and
5952,nothing the Chinese would not eat .
5953,It is not our purpose to discuss this dictum .
5954,Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at
5955,the progress of civilisation which allows a dish
5956,borrowed straight from the prehistoric . How
5957,"many centuries ago , in some cave or hilly"
5958,"hide , did our forebears home from the chase"
5959,hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of
5960,meat or fish burnt and roasted in the
5961,homely and protecting flame .
5962,How many centuries later did the mercenary in
5963,the Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his
5964,"evening meal . Later came the thrifty peasant ,"
5965,later still the young Victorian buck adventuring
5966,"in Paris , and even later our attractive young"
5967,ladies toying with these primitive morsels in the
5968,gleam and glitter of our latter-day restaurants .
5969,"And , if certain dishes and modes of food have"
5970,"persisted down the ages , the motive that preserved"
5971,them has always been the same . Apart from the need
5972,"for nourishment , the instinct of hospitality has"
5973,always been strong in mankind . The sharing of
5974,a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an
5975,admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
5976,important than the casual meetings of the present
5977,day ; the desire to share something more intimate
5978,than mere converse has always been there .
5979,The truth is that good food offers a
5980,programme of entertainment almost
5981,unlimited in its variety and its presen-
5982,tation affords an opportunity of
5983,showing a guest something of ourselves .
5984,It is a far enough cry from the primitive
5985,meal-times of a simpler world to the
5986,"banquets of later days , when the table"
5987,groaned under its load of complicated
5988,"dishes , and for all the blossoming of the"
5989,arts around them the diners were little
5990,There was always the spice of an orgy
5991,"in those Roman feasts , for instance , with"
5992,all their peacocks and nightingales'
5993,"tongues ; unreasonable surfeit , too , in the"
5994,elaborate fashion of eating brought
5995,"out of Italy into France , we are told ,"
5996,by Catherine de Medici . The peasant in
5997,"those days , as ever , ate sparingly , but"
5998,"generously enough in his own fashion ,"
5999,"save at feast times , when he , too , let"
6000,himself go ; and it was from his simpler
6001,"Epicures and gourmands , sated by the unending"
6002,procession of dishes from those mammoth kitchens
6003,of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of
6004,grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
6005,"the dishes of the country , and , instead of gorging the"
6006,"eye with magnitude , began to understand the value of"
6007,"intelligent selection and comparative simplicity , though"
6008,nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite
6009,monstrous .

6108,smother his courtiers with flowers . Nor was
6109,it entirely as an object of luxury that the
6110,ancients made use of flowers ; they were
6111,considered to possess sanative and
6112,medicinal qualities .
6113,"According to Pliny , and others , certain herbs"
6114,and flowers proved of sovereign power

6286,A Scottish knight - Sir John Mercer - was

6290,one of that new class of merchant financiers
6291,"which the city of London was now producing , fitted ,"
6292,equipped and manned a fleet from his own
6293,"resources , and captured the young Mercer in a"
6294,brilliant Channel fight .
6295,It was naturally a highly popular victory with the
6296,"Londoners , but it brought heavy censure from nobles"
6297,who still believed that they had a monopoly of
6298,"leadership . But , at last , Gaunt sailed . Opposing"
6299,"him was the French Admiral , Jean de Vienne -"
6300,a great sailor and an able strategist .
6301,"Obedient to the policy of his King , de Vienne avoided"
6302,trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it
6303,on land . Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for
6304,"an elusive foe , and , afraid to return home without"
6305,"something to show , he foolishly attempted to besiege"
6306,the well-protected fortress of St Malo . This
6307,involved the dreary method of mining operations in
6308,"which Gaunt , under the Black Prince , had shown"
6309,considerable skill at the siege of Limoges .
6310,"When all seemed to be going well , a sortie surprised"
6311,moment had charge of the mine ; the mine collapsed
6312,fame and glory . Gaunt was compelled to return
6313,"even despised failure . The ' ribald ' Londoners , who"
6314,"Hawley , were also expressing their disappointment"
6315,comparing the failure of a subsidized duke
6316,citizen .
6317,These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide
6318,obvious morals for those who are judges long
6319,"after the event . It seems obvious that , though"
6320,the longbows of yeomen could pierce the
6321,"plate and mail of French knights , a brilliant"
6322,"battle was no substitute for a sound policy ,"
6323,"and that , if archers had no target , campaigns"
6324,became mere marauding route marches .
6325,It seems obvious that if an expedition to
6326,"Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais ,"
6327,then the primary essential to the success
6328,of the French war was a navy in unquestioned
6329,command of the Channel . It seems obvious
6330,that divided forces were dissipating the
6331,advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included
6332,"Calais , Cherbourg , Brest , Bordeaux and Bayonne ,"
6333,and that there was no hope of final victory
6334,without a large-scale and concentrated invasion .
6335,BUT NONE OF THESE DEDUCTIONS WERE
6336,"DRAWN AT THE TIME , BECAUSE LARGE-"
6337,"SCALE WAR REQUIRED MONEY , AND"
6338,THE CITIZENS WHO HAD THE MONEY
6339,WERE NOT YET SUFFICIENTLY AT
6340,ONE WITH NOBLES AND KING TO THINK
6341,THEIR MONEY WELL SPENT IN FIN-
6342,ANCING A RULING CLASS WHICH
6343,DESPISED THEM . THE COMMONS WERE
6344,GLAD ENOUGH TO ENJOY THE FRUITS
6345,In this cruel process which was
6346,hammering out nations on the anvils of
6347,"war , there was a constant stirring of"
6348,those in authority to find some simple
6349,way out of the complicated financial
6350,"6impasse which always resulted , and in the"
6351,story of the experiments and expedients
6352,to which the Exchequer resorted is
6353,the story of the prelude to the
6354,Peasants' Revolt of 1381 .
6355,"In appreciating this story , modern con-"
6356,ceptions of governmental duties must be
6357,set aside . A modern government needs
6358,taxation not merely for defence and
6359,offence but for a very wide range of
6360,social services . A mediaeval oligarchy
6361,needed taxation in order to supplement
6362,the private wealth of the monarchy
6363,( the royal income from the revenues of
6364,"crown lands , the fees of feudalism"
6365,Social service as a function of government
6366,was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
6367,substitute was the mutual self-help of
6368,"communities , whether those communities were"
6369,"monasteries , manors , townships , or wards and"
6370,guilds of a city . A mediaeval tax was
6371,therefore in essence a forced payment whose
6372,return was the uncertain bounty of booty
6373,and the vague advantages of military glory ;
6374,it was therefore always granted grudgingly
6375,"and coupled with the vain hope that , in the"
6376,When ' his ' war did not bring victory and
6377,"booty , a new group of Lords might oust"
6378,"the unsuccessful leaders , and the Commons ,"
6379,"who usually supplied the hard cash , might"
6380,be bold enough to demand the production of
6381,"accounts , and even at times the impeachment of"
6382,the unsuccessful . But the Commons were not
6383,"the people , and even a full Parliament was"
6384,not yet a true mirror of the nation .
6385,The people - Langland's ' folk ' and Gaunt's
6386,' knaves ' - were villeins still tied to the
6387,feudal obligations of work or villeins who
6388,"had bought their release , free labourers"
6389,"who worked for the highest bidders , free"
6390,yeomen who had prospered enough to become
6391,"successful farmers , the artisans , craftsmen ,"
6392,journeymen and small tradesmen of the
6393,"towns , and the retainers and men-at-arms"
6394,in the pay of landed Lords .
6395,"None of these classes , except the yeomen , paid or"
6396,expected to pay direct taxes . During the four-
6397,"teenth century , the traditional methods of"
6398,financing the Exchequer had become stabilized .
6399,When the King and his Council required additio-
6400,"nal funds , they were usually granted an"
6401,"export tax on the wool trade , collected by"
6402,means of that ' staple ' system which ensured that
6403,"prices , quality and tax could be efficiently su-"
6404,"pervised and controlled , together with a"
6405,There were two other sources of public revenue -
6406,"first , the Church , which wisely followed the lead"
6407,of the Commons and in its own Convocations
6408,"granted equivalent contributions , and second ,"
6409,"the foreign merchants , with whom the King's"
6410,officials had formerly made private bargains
6411,"at ' colloquies of merchants ' , and whose"
6412,payments were now authorized by parliamentary
6413,sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
6414,excess of the rate for native merchants .
6415,"In addition to these revenues , the King had the"
6416,financial benefits of his position at the head
6417,"of the feudal system , as its chief landowner"
6418,and the recipient of the fines of royal justice .
6419,"It was , therefore , a complicated and not very"
6420,satisfactory financial system in which the
6421,borders between private and public purse were
6422,as ill-defined as the borders between private
6423,"and national war , and in which the comparati-"
6424,vely simple obligations of the feudal pyramid
6425,But this time there was a very interesting
6426,attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
6427,payments demanded . The definition of an
6428,"adult was altered to read ' over sixteen ' ,"
6429,"and , where the poorest were to pay a groat ,"
6430,the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
6431,"of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks ,"
6432,and between these two extremes a graduated
6433,scale of payments was fixed for the
6434,different classes of laymen and clerics .
6435,Again the resentment was widespread and
6436,the results disappointing - a tax estimated
6437,"to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000 ."
6438,"In the following year , 1380 , the last and"
6439,most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
6440,by a Parliament which met at Northampton .
6441,There were dark reasons for a meeting so
6442,far away from the capital in a town with
6443,poor communications and not over supplied
6444,with hostelries and lodgings .
6445,London was again in turmoil ; but this time
6446,over a question of trade rivalry . A rich mer-
6447,"chant from Genoa had been murdered , and"
6448,"John de Kyrkby , a Londoner , was one of"
6449,those charged with the crime . It is clear
6450,from the chronicles that this was a sordid
6451,quarrel between monopolists and interlopers .
6452,The city merchants were jealous of foreign
6453,merchants who could tempt court and
6454,baronage with rarer luxuries than those
6455,"A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure"
6456,"to mediaeval eyes . It was determined that 100,000"
6457,"was a fairer target , and the Parliament agreed to find"
6458,two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied
6459,the remainder . The method of assessment to which the
6460,Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax . The manifest
6461,injustice of this method had been to a certain degree
6462,"corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax ,"
6463,"but this lesson was ignored , and the injustice trebled in"
6464,weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult
6465,"had to pay three groats , but this time an adult was re-"
6466,Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
6467,"arithmetic which argued that , as the first"
6468,"poll-tax had supplied 22,000 , a tax of"
6469,"three times the rate would produce 66,000 ."
6470,The only concession made in view of the
6471,objections to the first two poll-taxes was
6472,the suggestion that the rich should help
6473,the poor - but this was only a pious hope
6474,because no machinery was provided for

6488,"to the movement of the arteries , likewise gauged from"

6586,in the Labour movement a more militant attitude
6587,capable of achieving socialism for the working
6588,people .
6589,"Alf Barton , who in 1911 was presented"
6590,"with a book on the life of Marx ,"
6591,and a gold purse in recognition of his
6592,"work for the movement , was later"
6593,known to say that it was not ne-
6594,cessary to understand Marxism in order to
6595,"understand socialism , though at this time"
6596,he was a keen member of the B.S.P. .
6597,Dr. Davidson said he would go for
6598,a walk over the fields while we attended
6599,"to our business . To my amusement ,"
6600,when we met at tea at the rectory
6601,"after the Dedication , the Archbishop"
6602,said he had been stopped by
6603,a farmer in a field . He seemed
6604,"rather indignant , but we took the"
6605,episode without a smile till afterwards .
6606,"The Hall proved most useful , especially in winter"
6607,when the distance to the church deterred many from
6608,coming to Sunday Evensong . We managed to furnish
6609,"a table with cross and candles , and the people"
6610,appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
6611,as for more secular purposes . In 1910 Dr. Talbot
6612,"was translated to Winchester , and Dr. Hubert"
6613,Burge became Bishop of Southwark .
6614,Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
6615,"work in connection with Higher Religious Education , and"
6616,to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
6617,Union . This meant organizing lectures and courses of
6618,"religious instruction through the Diocese , and I"
6619,also found myself a member of the Diocesan
6620,"Conference , where I remember introducing myself as"
6621,the incumbent of the highest church in the
6622,Diocese .
6623,There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
6624,"some quarters , until I explained that my church"
6625,was 800 feet high above the sea level ! The
6626,"work was growing pretty heavy , and we managed"
6627,to get a stipendiary layman who could help
6628,among the children and young people .
6629,It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
6630,in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play . The place and its people were
6631,to play an important part in my life . For five years in succession till
6632,"war broke out in 1914 , I spent my summer holidays there and became"
6633,very intimate with the people and the environs . Every year between the
6634,"Passion Plays , an interval of ten years , another play would be"
6635,"performed at the small theatre in the village , when new talent would"
6636,be discovered and trained .
6637,"After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit"
6638,"Germany for ten years , by which time in"
6639,1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
6640,Towards the end of my five and a half years'
6641,incumbency I was asked if I would start
6642,a village choral society and conduct it .
6643,"This opened up a new interest , and we plunged"
6644,into it .
6645,First of all simple part-songs : I found only one member who had
6646,any idea of reading music . This was the village doctor who was an
6647,old school friend at Clifton . He could sustain the tenor part quite well
6648,and lead the others . As for basses and altos the conductor had to
6649,"teach by singing the parts with them . It was very amusing , and by"
6650,the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
6651,could render simple part-singing tolerably well .
6652,Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's ' Hiawatha's
6653,"Wedding Feast . ' Enthusiasm grew , and in a few more months we"
6654,"gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster ,"
6655,and the tenor solo ' Onaway awake ' was sung by the Rector .
6656,"Friends from Limpsfield , in addition to the villagers , came up ,"
6657,and we were all happy .
6658,"IN 1913 Dr. Burge , Bishop of Southwark , asked me to go as"
6659,"Vicar of St. Mark's , Woodcote , Purley , a new church built"
6660,"by the well-known architect Mr. George Fellowes Prynne ,"
6661,"who was to become a very intimate friend , and I was"
6662,later on joint executor of his estate with his
6663,solicitor cousin . As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
6664,"ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield , we held"
6665,great family consultations .
6666,My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
6667,"his family , and found a very suitable house nearby"
6668,"where my mother settled , and eventually died in 1926"
6669,at the age of 92 . Dr. Burge was not able to be present
6670,at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's .
6671,"This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich ,"
6672,"Dr. John Leake , who lived at Blackheath , and was"
6673,a close friend of ours .
6674,But what a change from the dear little old church
6675,at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
6676,"at Purley . One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the"
6677,"church was , it had its own atmosphere , and for centuries"
6678,had been a House of Prayer . I could not but feel the
6679,"chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is ."
6680,When we had found a group of people who gladly
6681,"co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place"
6682,of daily prayer .
6683,I suggested to the congregation that it needed
6684,"warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we"
6685,found many to help . Gifts of candlesticks and
6686,stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
6687,helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
6688,for prayer and quiet . In time we received similar
6689,"gifts for the High Altar , and large East and West"
6690,windows .
6691,It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
6692,such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made
6693,a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
6694,"the architect , himself a fine artist . It is quite possible"
6695,to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
6696,and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
6697,table to the environs .
6698,We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
6699,"the Brighton Road , in a street full of small houses ."
6700,This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
6701,"there , but was soon changed into the better-"
6702,sounding name of Lansdowne Road . There
6703,"were lots of children there , and we had"
6704,a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
6705,service . I soon saw that the parish needed
6706,more help both at the church and Mission
6707,district .
6708,The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
6709,"Lansdowne Road district , but I needed more help in the"
6710,church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays .
6711,Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in
6712,"1913 soon after I had come , and he organized the Mission"
6713,"district and got to know , and be known by , many of"
6714,the people of the parish .
6715,A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
6716,"year , 1914 , when war broke out . Very soon Chaplains for"
6717,"the Forces were urgently needed , and I felt clearly"
6718,"that one of us must volunteer . The Bishop , Dr. Burge , did"
6719,"not wish me to go then , as I had barely been in the parish"
6720,"for a year . Mr. Evitt , however , was much less committed"
6721,"than his Vicar , and he was accepted at once and"
6722,was very soon in France where he did splendid
6723,work until his health broke down and he had a bad
6724,attack of enteric fever .
6725,Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
6726,co-operation especially with the other Christian communities .
6727,At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
6728,' Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund ' in whose counsels and committees
6729,"I found myself deeply involved . At first , the main work was to help"
6730,wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '
6731,"allowances , but soon , alas ! , as casualties began and increased"
6732,in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
6733,"became very urgent , and I was asked to be Chairman"
6734,of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley .
6735,"Indeed , for the next seventeen years , during my time at"
6736,"Purley , and from 1922 at Surbiton , I was continuously"
6737,Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee . This
6738,task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
6739,"the Committee . We had a splendid body of local residents ,"
6740,and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries . Our
6741,"Committee met once a week in the evenings , and"
6742,included professional men from every walk of
6743,life .
6744,Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
6745,were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen . Life was
6746,in those years more than busy . We now had a vicarage next
6747,"to the church , and I was most fortunate in having for eight"
6748,years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
6749,well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
6750,church .
6751,On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
6752,Purley she offered to come and look after me . She was
6753,"a real treasure , of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic"
6754,"things , a widow who knew how to look after the ' boy , '"
6755,who was the only other occupant of the house when
6756,Mr. Evitt had gone .
6757,We gathered together a splendid Sunday
6758,"afternoon service at the church , each child"
6759,"being given a number which , as they came into"
6760,"church , they could just whisper to"
6761,the superintendent who filled in the regi-
6762,ster at her own home . Each child had a
6763,picture given them and the lesson was
6764,largely based on this . It was on a
6765,stamp which could be stuck in
6766,"their book , and there was quite a"
6767,clamour for back stamps if a child
6768,had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause
6769,It was quite amusing to see how much
6770,"the children enjoyed the service , and I heard"
6771,of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
6772,naughty child with the penalty of not being
6773,allowed to come to the Children's Church
6774,on Sunday afternoon . I hope the threat
6775,"kept them good in the week , but anyway"
6776,"they were a most delightful lot , and"
6777,it is a great joy to meet them now
6778,fifty years afterwards when so many
6779,are parents or even grandparents
6780,Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
6781,me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
6782,lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
6783,continuing till old age to-day . When I went
6784,"to St. Mark's , the first contact I made was"
6785,"with the Vicar's Warden , Mr. F. W. Charlton"
6786,"and his family , the youngest of whose three"
6787,sons was just coming into the world in this year
6788,of 1913 .
6789,From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
6790,deep friendship which I have taken with me through
6791,all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry . Mr. and
6792,Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult
6793,"years of war , when most lives were upset and"
6794,"some tempers were easily frayed , the most"
6795,loyal and devoted friends .
6796,Their homes - for since those years they have
6797,lived on in Purley - have always been
6798,"havens of rest , and the welcome has never"
6799,"failed . Their three boys , now successful men ,"
6800,were in our Children's Church from the
6801,"outset , and when we don't see one"
6802,another we do not forget .
6803,"In those early years 1914-18 , life was very full"
6804,both in the parish and in the wider war activities .
6805,"The Bishop , knowing that I spent my holidays in"
6806,"Bavaria , asked me if I would do something for two wards"
6807,"at the Royal Herbert Hospital , full of war prisoners ."
6808,"I was very glad to help in this way , and visited them"
6809,"frequently , establishing at once a friendly contact with"
6810,the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
6811,someone who knew their native villages .
6812,I could at once notice the great antagonism
6813,between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly
6814,scorned these more simple country folk .
6815,Less than no response from the Russian side led
6816,one to fear that the event might well have the
6817,outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might
6818,lead to disaster . Then there had been much talk of
6819,the setting up among the German population of a
6820,"general system of "" francs-tireurs "" , to be named"
6821,""" Werewolves "" ."
6822,The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing
6823,more than a fantasy . Thanks to the good
6824,"sense of the front line soldiers , the"
6825,meeting of East and West was marked by
6826,the use of no weapon more lethal than
6827,vodka . And the effect on the German people
6828,of the first ten years of the promised
6829,"thousand of Nazi rule , so far from creating"
6830,"a spirit of warlike frenzy , had produced"
6831,universally a dull bewildered apathy .
6832,So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the
6833,""" Werewolves "" that we had contemplated the necessity of very"
6834,special precautions to guard the lives of our airmen . Particular
6835,"hatred , we felt , was bound to be aimed at the representatives of"
6836,"those who had , over the years , spread such ghastly havoc , destruction"
6837,"and death over Germany , causing such wholesale slaughter among"
6838,"men , women and children , old and young alike ."

8063,"Later in the year , the idea of some sort of"
8064,public employment was again in the air . Lady
8065,"Cowper , for instance , told Princess Lieven on"
8066,September 25th that Anglesey was very much
8067,annoyed at not obtaining the Admiralty in place
8068,"of Lord Auckland , who had gone to govern India ."
8069,"If there was any truth in this , Lord Melbourne's"
8070,"letter of the following day , offering Anglesey the"
8071,"Government of Gibraltar , may have been a"
8072,sop .
8073,"' It is ' , he wrote , ' one of the best military situations"
8074,which the Crown has to bestow - the salary has
8075,"been settled ... at five thousand pounds yearly , it"
8076,being understood that the Governor is not here-
8077,after to be absent from his post . It has struck
8078,me that 1altho' very improbable it is not quite
8079,impossible that you might be willing to accept of
8080,this appointment . '
8081,"The reply was not bereft of asperity : ' Beaudesert ,"
8082,"Sept. 27 , 1835 ' Dear Melbourne , ' I have received"

8084,"the remainder of my life at Gibraltar , & moreover"
8085,"( if even residence were not the condition ) , having"

8088,"' I remain , dear Melbourne , faithfully yours , ' ANGLESEY '"
8089,"Soon after his return from Europe , Clarence Paget"
8090,had become seriously ill with a supposed abscess
8091,"on the lungs . After months of suffering , his life was"
8092,almost despaired of when as a last resort it was
8093,suggested that the patient should be taken to consult
8094,Hahnemann once again .
8095,"It was no longer necessary to go further than Paris ,"
8096,for by this time the great man had been driven
8097,from his native Germany by the antipathy of his
8098,orthodox brethren . The main difficulty was how to
8099,make the expedition from England without killing the
8100,patient before he completed it . The problem was
8101,overcome in an interesting manner .
8102,"' Fortunately , ' wrote Clarence in after years , ' the"
8103,King ... remembered there was a luxurious old bed
8104,"travelling-carriage in the royal coach-houses , which"
8105,"had carried his brother , George 4 . , and he kindly"
8106,placed it at the disposal of my father . Into it I was
8107,"put , more dead than alive , and we got across to"
8108,"Calais , and from thence by easy stages to"
8109,Paris ...
8110,"He wrote down every symptom , examined me all"
8111,"over , asked ever so many questions which I had"
8112,"scarcely strength to answer , and took up his gold-"
8113,headed cane to depart . My father hung upon every
8114,"word , but could get nothing from him ."
8115,"WHEN HE SAW TRELAWNY'S PRINTED LETTER ,"
8116,LORD SIDNEY WROTE TO DOUGLAS KINNAIRD
8117,SAYING THAT IT WAS INCORRECT THROUGHOUT . HE
8118,HAD NO SOONER HEARD FROM COUNT GAMBA AND
8119,FLETCHER THAT BYRON WOULD HAVE WISHED
8120,HIS BODY TO RETURN TO ENGLAND THAN THAT

8124,"CONCURRENCE , WHILE ' GENERAL ADAM WAS AT"
8125,CORFU THE WHOLE TIME AND NEVER INTER-

8127,"When he saw Trelawny's printed letter , Lord Sidney wrote"
8128,to Douglas Kinnaird saying that it was incorrect
8129,throughout . He had no sooner heard from Count Gamba
8130,and Fletcher that Byron would have wished his
8131,body to return to England than that course was

8133,"and Sir Frederick Stoven , but with their perfect con-"

8136,degree about the matter ' .
8137,HIS ONLY REFERENCE TO TRELAWNY BY NAME IN
8138,THE COURSE OF SEVERAL COMMUNICATIONS TO
8139,HOBHOUSE AND KINNAIRD ABOUT BYRON'S AFFAIRS
8140,IS SATIRICAL : ' I HAVE NOT THE 1HONOR OF ANY
8141,ACQUAINTANCE WITH MR TRELAWNY WHO SEEMS TO
8142,HAVE HAD CHARGE OF THE MULE WHEN COUNT
8143,GAMBA ACCOMPANIED THE REMAINS OF OUR
8144,DECEASED FRIEND TO ZANTE ... . . ' IF TRELAWNY
8145,FAILED EVEN TO MEET LORD SIDNEY AND THE
8146,BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S OTHER REPRESENTATIVES
8147,"IN THE ISLANDS , WHILE THEY WARMLY WELCOMED ..."
8148,His only reference to Trelawny by name in the course of several
8149,communications to Hobhouse and Kinnaird about Byron's affairs is
8150,satirical : ' I have not the 1honor of any acquaintance with Mr
8151,Trelawny who seems to have had charge of the Mule when Count
8152,Gamba accompanied the remains of our deceased friend to Zante ... . '
8153,If Trelawny failed even to meet Lord Sidney and the British
8154,"Government's other representatives in the islands , while they"
8155,"warmly welcomed Gamba to their counsels , it would go far to"
8156,explain his attempts to exalt himself at the young
8157,Italian's expense .
8158,IN HIS POPULAR AND ACUTELY UNRELIABLE
8159,"BOOK ON BYRON AND SHELLEY , TRELAWNY"
8160,IMPLIES THAT NOT ONLY GAMBA BUT FLETCHER
8161,"AND TITA AND THE STEWARD , LEGA ZAMBELLI ,"
8162,FAILED TO PERFORM THE MOST ELEMENTARY
8163,DUTIES TOWARDS THE DEAD . HE PRETENDS
8164,TO HAVE FOUND EVERYTHING IN UTTERMOST
8165,DISORDER - ' TOKENS THAT THE PILGRIM
8166,"HAD MOST TREASURED , SCATTERED ON THE"
8167,"FLOOR , - AS RUBBISH OF NO MARKE-"
8168,"TABLE VALUE , AND TRAMPLED ON ' ."
8169,In his popular and acutely unreliable book on Byron and
8170,"Shelley , Trelawny implies that not only Gamba but Fletcher"
8171,"and Tita and the steward , Lega Zambelli , failed to perform"
8172,the most elementary duties towards the dead . He pretends
8173,to have found everything in uttermost disorder - ' tokens that
8174,"the Pilgrim had most treasured , scattered on the floor , -"
8175,"as rubbish of no marketable value , and trampled on ' ."
8176,This was to give colour to his pretext for copying Byron's last
8177,"letter to his sister , which was that its chance of reaching its"
8178,destination had seemed slight . The collection of Pietro
8179,Gamba's letters deposited among the Murray manuscripts show
8180,that the greatest care was observed in gathering together all the possessions
8181,of a man whose importance was fully recognized by everyone about
8182,"him . ' I have had put under Government seal his belongings ,"
8183,which will be opened by Prince Alexander Mavrocordato
8184,in my presence and that of certain Englishmen who are
8185,here .
8186,I have taken an exact inventory of them . '
8187,"Thus on April 21st , several days before"
8188,"Trelawny appeared , Gamba wrote to Lord"
8189,"Sidney Osborne , and his inventory has been"
8190,preserved . The papers were reopened in the
8191,presence of leading Missolonghi officials
8192,in order to make sure that no recent will
8193,was amongst them .
8194,"I have taken an exact inventory of them . ' Thus on April 21st , several"
8195,"days before Trelawny appeared , Gamba wrote to Lord Sidney Osborne ,"
8196,and his inventory has been preserved . The papers were reopened in
8197,the presence of leading Missolonghi officials in order to make
8198,sure that no recent will was amongst them .
8199,It may have been then that Trelawny contrived to do
8200,his copying . Considering that Pietro was not above
8201,twenty-three years of age when he undertook a load
8202,"of heavy responsibilities , his conduct reveals him as"
8203,one of the most intelligent as well as the most
8204,sympathetic of Byron's 6entourage in Greece . With
8205,his good looks - for he ' carried the passport of a very
8206,handsome person ' - his good manners and his perfect
8207,"lack of pretension , he even succeeded in disarming"
8208,Hobhouse's possessiveness and making him forget how
8209,"deeply he had disapproved , less than two years"
8210,"Augusta Leigh too was favourably impressed ,"
8211,and wrote to Lady Byron after she had
8212,received a visit from him : I have today seen
8213,Count Gamba - which was very distressing
8214,for many reasons but quite unavoidable - he
8215,"is a pleasing , fine looking young man &"
8216,spoke with great feeling . The unfortunate
8217,Augusta was in one of her worst states of
8218,confusion .
8219,"Augusta Leigh too was favourably impressed , and wrote"
8220,to Lady Byron after she had received a visit from

8226,"She had loved Byron , but she had"
8227,"betrayed him , betrayed him not twice , as"
8228,"he had betrayed her , but again and again"
8229,"over a long span of time , fawning on his"
8230,"implacable wife , purveying to her in secret"
8231,the unguarded letters he never suspected
8232,"any eye but her own would see , feeding"
8233,the stealthy fires of her animosity : and
8234,"having betrayed him , she had grown to fear"
8235,and almost to hate him .
8236,"She had loved Byron , but she had betrayed him ,"
8237,"betrayed him not twice , as he had betrayed her ,"
8238,"but again and again over a long span of time ,"
8239,"fawning on his implacable wife , purveying to her"
8240,in secret the unguarded letters he never
8241,"suspected any eye but her own would see ,"
8242,feeding the stealthy fires of her animosity :
8243,"and having betrayed him , she had grown to"
8244,fear and almost to hate him .
8245,She had dreaded his outpourings of affection
8246,for her in poetry that he thought would clear
8247,"her and that only compromised her , and the"
8248,headstrong folly that tempted him to write on
8249,"ever more daring themes , teaching the world"
8250,to guess what repentance and unrepentance
8251,preyed upon his thoughts .
8252,She had dreaded his outpourings of affection for
8253,her in poetry that he thought would clear
8254,"her and that only compromised her , and #"
8255,the headstrong folly that tempted him to
8256,"write on ever more daring themes , teaching"
8257,the world to guess what repentance and
8258,unrepentance preyed upon his thoughts .
8259,She had dreaded still more that he might
8260,"return to England , overshadowing her again"
8261,with spiritual and social peril . But this kind
8262,of return was what she could never have
8263,foreseen ... that he # should come back not
8264,"voluble but silent , not beautiful but defaced ,"
8265,not in obloquy but with his praises ringing !
8266,"She could remember now his exciting laughter ,"
8267,"his almost filial love for her , her almost"
8268,maternal love for him .
8269,Above all she could remember the anguish of their
8270,"parting , and how he had been ' convulsed , absolutely"
8271,"convulsed with grief ' . So love revived , and in"
8272,its most sentimental form . While he lived
8273,she had lost touch in her perpetual alarms
8274,with what was best in him ; dead his memory
8275,became sacred to her .
8276,She felt almost as strongly as Hobhouse
8277,# about biographies . Quite apart from the
8278,divagations of her ' poor brother ' - so she
8279,constantly referred to him - there were a
8280,hundred reasons why it would be
8281,objectionable to have the family history
8282,exposed . Whatever latitude she allowed in
8283,the warmth of her kindly nature to others -
8284,or to herself - she believed implicitly in
8285,the moral code she had learned from
8286,"her good grandmother , the Countess of"
8287,She had no desire to see in print that her
8288,"mother , who was to have been a duchess , had"
8289,been involved in a scandalous and ruinous
8290,"divorce , that her father , ' Mad Jack Byron ' , was"
8291,a profligate and a bankrupt who had
8292,squandered every penny two successive wives
8293,had brought him and left the second on
8294,"the verge of destitution , and that he had died"
8295,"a drunkard and perhaps a suicide , hiding"
8296,in France to escape his creditors .
8297,It was no more pleasant for the Hon. Augusta
8298,Leigh to share this kind of story with the world
8299,than it would be for most 20th-century ladies
8300,moving in court circles and having children to
8301,be settled advantageously in life . She had lived
8302,down the rumours which had made the year of
8303,"the Byron separation a nightmare to her , and she"
8304,"had also succeeded , though with an increasing"
8305,"sense of effort , in persuading her little world to"
8306,"avert its eyes from her husband , ' that drone ' ,"
8307,"as # Byron called him , whose career of"
8308,She had earned the right to be left in peace .
8309,"Byron's fame was , of course , very wonderful , but"
8310,it carried with it too many reminders of his
8311,"terrible indiscretions - the writing of Don Juan ,"
8312,"which she had never ceased to deplore , his"
8313,"shocking blasphemies like the Vision of Judgement ,"
8314,his making friends with the atheist known to
8315,"her as ' that infamous Mr. Shelley ' , and his"
8316,mixing with really low and horrid people such
8317,"as the subversive journalist Leigh Hunt , whom"
8318,on would never conceivably meet in decent society .
8319,She was most emphatically opposed to the
8320,"production of sheer indelicacies , and that was"
8321,the light in which she saw the proposed book
8322,by Dallas . Letters between a mother and a son -
8323,a son so outspoken and a mother so far from
8324,suitable to be paraded before the public !
8325,"And brought out by that seedy poor relation ,"
8326,Dallas ! Could anything be in worse taste ?
8327,"Hanson , the solicitor , was naturally remunerated"
8328,"for his services , but all Mr Hobhouse's duties"
8329,as executor were performed without reward .
8330,And now there was more trouble brewing
8331,with those unbearable Dallases . Dallas
8332,senior was detained in Paris by severe
8333,"illness , but Dallas junior was full of"
8334,fight and applying for the injunction
8335,to be lifted .
8336,"He had gone to Byron's cousin , now 7th"
8337,"lord , and had got him to compose an"
8338,"affidavit to the effect that , whereas he"
8339,had formerly been reluctant to approve the
8340,publication unless it had first been
8341,examined by the relatives and friends of
8342,"his predecessor , he had now read the"
8343,book and was content for it to be
8344,issued without that precaution .
8345,There were few things in Augusta's whole
8346,"life , full of calamities though it was , that"
8347,hurt her more than this contemptuous slight
8348,"from George Anson Byron , whom she had"
8349,"loved with an unswerving loyalty , and had looked"
8350,"on as her intimate friend . Moreover , he"
8351,was without the right to make such
8352,pronouncements : he had inherited nothing
8353,"from her brother but his title , whereas"
8354,she was not only of nearer consanguinity
8355,but the chosen recipient of his property .
8356,"These , if she had only known it , were"
8357,precisely the reasons why her cousin took
8358,pleasure in the opportunity of annoying her .
8359,Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have
8360,"intimate friends , and in every instance where"
8361,"the occasion was granted her , she managed"
8362,"to find some excuse for bestowing , in whole"
8363,"or in part , those confidences which never"
8364,failed to leave her audience agape with
8365,wonder at her magnanimity and Augusta's
8366,wickedness .
8367,George Anson Byron had seen enough of
8368,the poet's atrocious conduct as a husband
8369,"to be aware that Augusta , so far from"
8370,being responsible for the collapse of the
8371,"marriage , had been Lady Byron's greatest"
8372,support and comfort at the time ; but it
8373,had been deemed necessary all the
8374,same to enlighten him as to the suspicions
8375,"in the background , and he had repeated"
8376,them to his newly married wife .
8377,Their friendship for Augusta became rather
8378,"hollow , and the news that Byron had left"
8379,her practically all his money caused it to
8380,crumble to oblivion . Though Lady Byron
8381,"knew perfectly well that Byron , as early"
8382,"as the year of their wedding , 1815 , had"
8383,"made a will in Augusta's favour , she had"
8384,evidently not passed on that information ;
8385,and it came as an appalling surprise to
8386,Captain Byron that he had been left
8387,without the fortune that would keep up the
8388,title .
8389,"' Respecting the will ' , he wrote to Byron's widow a few days after"
8390,"hearing its contents , ' the very thought of it is painful to me ."
8391,"What Mary has said about it is too true . ' What Mary , the"
8392,"new Lady Byron , had said about it was written on the first half"
8393,"sheet of the same paper : My dearest Annabella , The more we"
8394,"consider the most prominent subject in your letter , the more"
8395,we are convinced of the truth of that dreadful history
8396,connected with it .
8397,Questions about marriage and children were
8398,"again included , as they had been at the"
8399,1911 and 1951 Censuses . The former had asked
8400,"for marriage details for all married women ,"
8401,the latter for all married women under
8402,the age of 50 . The 1961 Census questions
8403,related to all women who were or had been
8404,"married , and so repeated the enquiry made"
8405,fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family
8406,Census conducted on behalf of the Royal
8407,Commission on Population .
8408,"The questions about children were the same as in 1951 ,"
8409,except that they extended to all women who were or had
8410,been married . It was not regarded as practicable within
8411,the limits of the census to include particulars about
8412,"the date of birth of each child , as had been done"
8413,in the specialised enquiry for the Royal Commission .
8414,"The innovation at the 1961 Census , though the"
8415,Family Census had previously included
8416,"the question , was the date of termination"
8417,of the first or only marriage . This enables
8418,statistical use to be made of their experience
8419,as regards duration of marriage and
8420,number of children in the case of women
8421,whose first or only marriage was terminated
8422,by widowhood or divorce after the end
8423,of their child bearing life .
8424,This is particularly important in estimating the trends
8425,in the size and pattern of families for successive
8426,"generations over as long a period as possible , as the"
8427,proportion of widows predominates in the higher age
8428,groups . In Wales and Monmouthshire the question
8429,on the ability to speak Welsh was included as
8430,"previously . The question was first asked in 1891 , and"
8431,was given its present form in 1931 .
8432,Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions
8433,about housing and households . In 1961 the scope of the
8434,"question was wider than before , because of the great"
8435,use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local
8436,"Government and to local authorities . As before , the record"
8437,"made during the enumeration lists all buildings , residen-"
8438,"tial premises and temporary places of abode , and all"
8439,"households occupying them , as the basis of the"
8440,enumeration is the household schedule .
8441,"The number of structurally separate dwellings ( that is ,"
8442,houses or flats or other quarters built or adapted for
8443,separate occupation and forming a private and structurally
8444,"separate unit ) was obtained as previously , together with the"
8445,number of households with sole occupation or sharing
8446,"such dwellings , and the number of living rooms occu-"
8447,pied by each household .
8448,"A new question asked about housing tenure , whether"
8449,the accommodation occupied by each household was held by
8450,them as owner-occupiers ; occupied in connection with
8451,employment or as part of business premises ; rented
8452,from a Council ( or New Town Corporation ) or a private
8453,"landlord ( if so , whether furnished or unfurnished ) ; or"
8454,occupied on some other terms . The analysis of private
8455,households by size and various characteristics of their
8456,members has become increasingly important .
8457,"Previously , while visitors were left out of this"
8458,analysis it was not considered sufficiently
8459,important to attempt the task of bringing
8460,in the members away from home on Census
8461,"night , which would be very laborious in the"
8462,absence of information given at their place
8463,of usual residence ( n log n ) . But the need
8464,for a more accurate distribution of
8465,households by size as usually constituted
8466,"had become more important by 1961 , and"
8467,"accordingly a new question was introduced , ..."
8468,The information collected under
8469,this head will not affect the
8470,"main count of population numbers ,"
8471,but will be used solely in the
8472,analysis of households by size
8473,and other characteristics . Sample . -
8474,At an early stage of the census
8475,preparations consideration was
8476,given to possibilities of reducing
8477,the amount of clerical work before ...
8478,We have held eleven meetings . We decided as a
8479,first step to seek information from a number
8480,of organisations and persons having an interest
8481,in the questions before us and at a later stage we
8482,arranged for publication of a press notice inviting
8483,anybody interested to submit representations . We
8484,compiled a list of the points which we thought
8485,"were of importance , but we made it clear that"
8486,the replies need not be confined to these
8487,particular items .
8488,"As a general rule we did not ask for oral evidence , though"
8489,we found it an advantage in certain instances . Appendix
8490,1 gives a list of the bodies and persons consulted . The
8491,"Department of Health for Scotland , the Home Office and"
8492,the Ministry of Health submitted evidence to us ;
8493,officers of these Departments attended our meetings
8494,and have given us valuable assistance .
8495,"On 23rd November , 1959 , we submitted"
8496,an Interim Report . This dealt with two questions
8497,which arose from our terms of reference and
8498,which had been brought specially to our notice .
8499,"First , we were asked to examine the risks"
8500,attending the abuse of carbromal and
8501,bromvaletone and preparations containing these
8502,substances . The Poisons Board had already
8503,"considered this problem but , in the absence of"
8504,sufficient evidence that these compounds
8505,4 . On examination of the evidence it became clear
8506,to us that carbromal and bromvaletone were examples
8507,of a number of drugs on sale to the public which
8508,were not appropriate for restriction to supply on
8509,"prescription under the Dangerous Drugs Act , 1951 ,"
8510,"or the Therapeutic Substances Act , 1956 , and had"
8511,not so far been recommended for control as
8512,poisons .
8513,"5 . We recommended that , in general , any drug or"
8514,pharmaceutical preparation which has an action on the
8515,central nervous system and is liable to produce physical
8516,or psychological deterioration should be confined to supply
8517,on prescription and that an independent expert body
8518,should be responsible for advising which substances
8519,should be so controlled . 6 . As an interim and urgent
8520,"measure , the Secretary of State for the Home Department ,"
8521,"on the recommendation of the Poisons Board , has"
8522,We are glad to note the action that has been taken
8523,and we hope that arrangements will be made to ensure
8524,"that , as other preparations affecting the central nervous"
8525,"system become available , they too will be brought to"
8526,"the notice of the Poisons Board , or such other advisory"
8527,body as may in due course be appointed for the
8528,"purpose , to consider whether there are sufficient"
8529,grounds for restricting any of them also to supply
8530,on prescription .
8531,8 . The second part of our Interim Report was
8532,devoted to anaesthetists who become addicted
8533,to the gases and vapours which they use in the
8534,course of their professional duties . We
8535,ascertained that the incidence of this irregular-
8536,"ity was very small indeed . However , over a"
8537,"period of eleven years , patients' lives had been"
8538,endangered in two known instances .
8539,We were assured by our expert witnesses on this
8540,"subject that , with the apparatus at present to hand , the"
8541,preliminary sniffing of the gases immediately before
8542,administering them to a patient was a recognised and
8543,necessary precaution . We accepted this . 10 . In view of
8544,the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every
8545,anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted
8546,to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be
8547,entrusted with their administration .
8548,"The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee , whose advice"
8549,"we were invited to review , were to advise on : ( a ) the"
8550,"circumstances , if any , in which the supply of morphine"
8551,"and heroin , and preparations containing these substances ,"
8552,to persons addicted to those drugs might be regarded
8553,as medically advisable ; ( b ) the precautions which medical
8554,practitioners administering or prescribing morphine or
8555,heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any
8556,administrative measures that seemed expedient to
8557,secure observance of those precautions .
8558,12 . Through the system of records and
8559,inspection then in operation cases were
8560,brought to the notice of the Home Office
8561,at that time in which exceptionally
8562,large quantities of morphine and heroin
8563,had been supplied to particular practi-
8564,tioners or prescribed for individual
8565,cases . On further enquiry it was
8566,ascertained that sometimes the
8567,doctor had ordered these drugs simply
8568,13 . It appeared then that in some circumstances
8569,dangerous drugs were being supplied in
8570,contravention of the intention of Parliament
8571,that a doctor should be authorised to supply
8572,drugs only so far as was necessary for the
8573,practice of his profession . Before deciding on
8574,measures to secure proper observance of
8575,"the law , it was felt necessary to have"
8576,some authoritative medical advice on various
8577,"aspects of the treatment of addiction , ..."
8578,The Rolleston Committee's recommen-
8579,dations in 1926 on the supply of morphine
8580,and heroin to addicts to these drugs and
8581,on the use of drugs in treatment are discussed
8582,"later in this Report . They have , up to now ,"
8583,been included in the Memorandum on
8584,the Dangerous Drugs Act and Regulations
8585,which is prepared by the Home Office
8586,for the information of doctors and
8587,dentists .
8588,"The Secretary of State was empowered , on the recommendation of a"
8589,"tribunal , to withdraw a doctor's authority to possess and supply"
8590,"dangerous drugs and to direct that such a doctor , or a doctor"
8591,"convicted of an offence under the Act , should not issue"
8592,prescriptions for dangerous drugs . ( 3 ) It was made clear
8593,that prescriptions should only be given by a duly qualified
8594,medical practitioner when required for purposes of
8595,medical treatment .
8596,"Nevertheless , average net family income"
8597,was appreciably higher in families with
8598,"several children than in those with only ,"
8599,many of which were incomplete families
8600,"of younger parents with lower earnings ,"
8601,and of course with lower tax reliefs and
8602,no family allowances . The rise in net family
8603,incomes between 1954 and 1959 was great-
8604,"est for childless couples , especially older"
8605,couples ( probably because of the
8606,"Compared with 1958 , the expenditure index for 1959"
8607,showed increases of 4 to 6 per cent for couples without
8608,"children and those with one child , and much smaller"
8609,changes for couples with several children . The quantity
8610,"index , which has risen only slowly since 1956 , was"
8611,almost unchanged in 1959 for couples with two or more
8612,"children , but rose by 3 per cent in the older two-adult"
8613,households and by 1-2 per cent for younger childless
8614,couples and couples with one child .
8615,"As in 1958 , younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent"
8616,"more per calorie than the national average , and families"
8617,with four or more children 19 per cent less . The only
8618,"substantial change was in families with three children ,"
8619,for whom the index declined from 91 to 88 . Table 27
8620,also shows the corresponding values of an index which
8621,compares the prices paid by different types of household
8622,for the commodities constituting the average household
8623,diet in 1959 .
8624,For all foods the range was from 3.6 per cent above the national average
8625,in younger two-adult households to 4.8 per cent below in families with
8626,"four or more children , compared with +3.6 to -5.4 per cent in 1958"
8627,"and +2.8 to -2.6 per cent in 1957 . As with the price of energy index ,"
8628,"the only noteworthy change was for households with three children ,"
8629,in which the index fell by 1.8 to 97.5 per cent of the average for
8630,all households in the sample .
8631,"The price ranges for milk ,"
8632,"cheese , sugar , bread and flour"
8633,were very narrow . For most other
8634,foods younger childless couples paid
8635,the highest average prices and
8636,"large families the lowest , the price"
8637,gradients being steepest for
8638,"carcase meat ( +7 to -7 per cent ) ,"
8639,""" other "" fish ( +8 to -11 ) , "" other "" vegetables"
8640,( +9 to -9 ) and beverages other than
8641,tea ( +12 to -16 ) .
8642,Consumption by younger childless couples declined
8643,"throughout this period , but that of the smaller families was"
8644,maintained except for the slight fall in 1959 . In the largest
8645,"families , particularly those containing four or more children ,"
8646,there was a tendency for consumption to increase between 1955 and
8647,"1957 , and thereafter to decline . Graduated scales of family"
8648,"allowances were introduced in October 1956 , and the welfare"
8649,milk subsidy was reduced in April 1957 .
8650,75 . The smaller families and the residual groups of
8651,households containing children reduced their consumption
8652,"of sugar and of preserves , but in all other types of"
8653,household a decline in purchases of the one was
8654,accompanied by an increase in consumption of the other .
8655,76 . Most groups spent slightly less on potatoes than in
8656,"the previous year , but consumption was maintained"
8657,except in families with more than one child and in
8658,the unclassified households with children or
8659,adolescents .
8660,All groups except families with four or more children
8661,or with adolescents but no children consumed more fresh green
8662,"vegetables , especially in the first half of the year , although most"
8663,reduced their consumption of other vegetables . Purchases of
8664,"quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased , but extreme-"
8665,"ly wide group differences persisted , the averages ranging from"
8666,0.1 oz. per head per week in families with four or more
8667,children to 0.9 oz. per head in younger two-adult
8668,households ; average consumption by older couples and other
8669,wholly-adult households was 0.5 oz. per head per week .
8670,The two latter groups consumed much smaller
8671,quantities per head of canned vegetables and canned and
8672,"bottled tomatoes than any other group , and much smaller"
8673,quantities of canned and bottled fruit than younger
8674,"childless couples ; in households containing children ,"
8675,consumption of canned fruit fell off sharply with
8676,"increasing family size , but there was no regular"
8677,gradation in purchases of canned vegetables and canned
8678,tomatoes .
8679,All types of household benefited from the improved
8680,supplies and lower prices of fresh fruit compared
8681,"with 1958 , but the increase in consumption was"
8682,least in families containing children . 77 . Total
8683,"bread consumption was virtually unchanged ,"
8684,although most types of household bought less
8685,white bread and more rolls and speciality
8686,breads than in 1958 . Most groups increased
8687,"their purchases of puddings , cakes and biscuits ,"
8688,but obtained less flour .
8689,78 . Regression estimates of the expenditure on
8690,different commodities attributable to the adult
8691,couple and each additional child in a selected
8692,group of households consisting of childless couples
8693,( both under 55 ) and couples with different numbers
8694,of children were given for 1952-56 in Table 39 of
8695,the Annual Report for 1956 . The younger childless
8696,couples are broadly comparable in age and family
8697,"income with the family households , so that differences"
8698,in food expenditure may be associated with the
8699,presence of children .
8700,"The relative expenditure per child declined from 1952 to 1956 ,"
8701,but rose in 1957 when the subsidy on welfare and national dried
8702,milk was reduced ; since 1957 it has again declined . Most of the
8703,"average expenditure associated with a child was on cereal foods ,"
8704,"potatoes and milk ; for fresh green vegetables , fruit , cheese , fish and"
8705,"carcase meat , the incremental expenditure was slight ."
8706,79 . Table 30 shows the energy value and nutrient content of
8707,the diets of households of different composition . The averages
8708,"showed little change compared with those for the previous year ,"
8709,except for generally increased intakes of vitamins C and D .
8710,"Since physiological requirements vary widely with age , sex"
8711,"and level of activity , comparisons between families of different"
8712,composition are only apposite when considered in relation
8713,to needs .
8714,"80 . Estimates of the adequacy of the diets , assessed by"
8715,comparison with allowances based on the recommendations
8716,"of the British Medical Association , are also shown in Table 30 ."
8717,"In comparison with the previous year , changes were small"
8718,except for higher estimates for vitamin C . In families with
8719,four or more children the levels of adequacy for all
8720,nutrients other than vitamin C decreased slightly .
8721,"For this fairly small group , comparisons between different"
8722,years cannot be made so precisely as in groups with a
8723,defined number of children . In 1959 the households in
8724,this group contained slightly more children ( average 4.64 )
8725,than in the previous year ( average 4.53 ) . Their total food
8726,"expenditure increased less than that in other groups ,"
8727,"and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish ,"
8728,"poultry , eggs , canned vegetables , fresh fruit , chocolate"
8729,"biscuits and breakfast cereals which , in general , are more"
8730,expensive sources of nutrients than those foods of which
8731,"they purchased less , namely dried milk , potatoes , carcase"
8732,"meat , sugar , bread , flour and oatmeal and oat products ."
8733,5 . Other forms of war damage payment made by the Commission
8734,"are highway payments , clearance payments ( for clearing remains of"
8735,"structures from "" total loss "" sites ) and church payments . Although"
8736,differing in certain important ways from the ordinary cost of
8737,"works payments , the sums paid under these heads have the"
8738,common feature that they are all payments in respect of works
8739,which have been carried out .
8740,To provide fuller information about certain types of
8741,"dangerous occurrence , Section 65 of the Factories Act ,"
8742,"1937 , requires notification of certain specified"
8743,"occurrences to H.M. District Inspectors of Factories ,"
8744,whether or not they result in injury . Appendix 20
8745,gives figures of dangerous occurrences reported in
8746,1960 ; the types of occurrence which have to be
8747,reported are set out in the heading to the Appendix .
8748,The total number of dangerous occurrences reported
8749,"during the year was 1,409 , an increase of 111 over"
8750,"the total for 1959 . However , the number of"
8751,notifiable accidents associated with occurrences fell
8752,from 252 ( 31 of them fatal ) in 1959 to
8753,245 ( 22 fatal ) in 1960 . The main increase in
8754,the numbers of occurrences reported occurred in the
8755,category of those due to the collapse or
8756,"failure of a crane , derrick , winch or hoist , where"
8757,there was an increase of almost one-third from
8758,335 to 438 .
8759,The equipment takes two forms - an insulating
8760,"guard on the jib of the crane , intended to"
8761,"prevent direct contact with the line , and"
8762,electronic equipment with a sensitive probe
8763,mounted slightly forward of the head of the
8764,jib and with electronic assembly
8765,and warning apparatus in the driver's
8766,cab . Improved designs of both forms
8767,are being tried out at present .
8768,"There is , however , a danger that workers"
8769,will rely too much on fixed devices because
8770,they fail to recognise their limitations .
8771,It is therefore safer both in principle and
8772,practice to keep the worker away from
8773,"overhead lines wherever possible , e.g. , by"
8774,"( 1 ) re-routing the line , ( 2 ) putting the supply"
8775,"underground , ( 3 ) making the line"
8776,dead ( after consultation with the supply
8777,"authority ) , ( 4 ) providing barriers at a safe"
8778,distance to prevent vehicles from approaching
8779,It is also important to remember that on
8780,lines carrying the higher voltages flashover
8781,from the line may take place without
8782,actual contact . A new type of
8783,machine has recently been developed for
8784,the automatic rolling of sole leather
8785,bends . The sheet of leather is placed
8786,on a sliding feed tray outside the
8787,danger zone and is then pushed
8788,"forward between two platens , the upper"
8789,one carrying a set of small rollers .
8790,"The lower platen , which supports the"
8791,"leather , is raised hydraulically to bring"
8792,it into contact with the rollers on the upper
8793,"platen , which is then caused to make"
8794,several horizontal oscillations so that the
8795,leather is rolled and pressed at the same time .
8796,The danger zone between the platens is fenced
8797,by a guard which is interlocked with the
8798,hydraulic valve and the press is also
8799,sequentially operated : the closing of the shutter
8800,"starts the machine , the rest of the cycle"
8801,following automatically .
8802,A new method of applying sand to the
8803,faces of green bricks has recently been
8804,developed . In the case of wire-cut bricks
8805,the column of clay from the pug-mill is
8806,carried by a short length of belt
8807,conveyor to the sanding plant .
8808,This consists basically of a vibrating
8809,hopper from which the sand is
8810,distributed to all four faces by a
8811,"system of slots , scrapers and worms ."
8812,The conveyor is broken at this point to
8813,enable the sand to be applied to
8814,"the under surface of the column , which"
8815,passes on through two pairs of
8816,vibrating rollers which embed the sand
8817,firmly in the surfaces and is finally
8818,cut into bricks at the wire cutting
8819,table .
8820,"Of over 7,000,000 square feet of factory space built by the"
8821,"development corporations , about 20 per cent represents"
8822,extensions built after the firms had become established .
8823,It is the policy of the corporations to charge full rack-
8824,rents or ground rents for their factories or industrial
8825,sites ; and rents vary considerably according to the demand
8826,for factory accommodation .
8827,The average gross return on established industrial estates
8828,"ranges from 7 to 9 per cent of the capital expenditure on land ,"
8829,site works and buildings . Manufacturing industry affords
8830,employment to large numbers of non-manual as well as
8831,manual workers . An analysis made by Crawley Development
8832,"Corporation in 1958 , after collating replies from fifty-eight"
8833,"manufacturing firms employing over nine thousand staff ,"
8834,showed that 5 per cent of the staff were classed as
8835,"managerial and administrative , 11 per cent as technical"
8836,or employed in research and 19 per cent as clerical .
8837,There is no reason to suppose that this pattern is peculiar to
8838,Crawley . The development corporations have aimed at a varied
8839,"pattern of industry , offering a reasonable choice of"
8840,"employer as well as choice of occupation for men , women and"
8841,"school-leavers , with due regard to the industries"
8842,"already established in their towns . Inevitably engineering ,"
8843,"including the motor vehicle and aircraft industries ,"
8844,predominates in all the London new towns since these are
8845,among the industries which have expanded most
8846,during the last ten years in the country generally .
8847,Of those at present employed in manufacturing industry
8848,in the eight London new towns about 40 per cent are
8849,employed in engineering and electrical goods manufacture -
8850,the proportion employed in both these groups combined
8851,varies from about 30 per cent in Welwyn to 85 per cent in
8852,Stevenage and 90 per cent in Hatfield .
8853,These figures are much higher than the national
8854,"averages , and may be thought to indicate a"
8855,lack of balance in some of the towns . On the other
8856,hand these groups offer fairly varied opportunities of
8857,skilled employment and are highly diversified
8858,"as regards products , markets and methods of"
8859,manufacture . Consumer goods industries such as the
8860,"manufacture of food # and drink , tobacco , clothing"
8861,and footwear are under-represented in the new
8862,towns generally though not in Basildon and
8863,Welwyn .
8864,The following table indicates the size of the
8865,"firms , some of them occupying more than"
8866,"one factory , introduced or sponsored by"
8867,development corporations in the new towns : The
8868,overall average for the factories sponsored by
8869,development corporations is about 170 employees
8870,"per firm , and the average for each of the London"
8871,"new towns is roughly the same except at Hatfield ,"
8872,"where it is much lower , and Stevenage , where it"
8873,is much higher .
8874,The position at Stevenage is accounted for by
8875,"the presence of one firm with 3,700 employees"
8876,"and two others with over 1,000 employees ."
8877,About 32 per cent of all the workers employed
8878,in factories sponsored by the development
8879,corporations are employed by the eleven
8880,largest firms and about 23 per cent by the next
8881,group of firms employing between five
8882,hundred and one thousand workers .
8883,In factories sponsored by the London new town
8884,development corporations the proportion of
8885,"female employees , expressed as a percentage"
8886,"of all employees , varies from 23 per cent in"
8887,Welwyn Garden City and 24 per cent in
8888,Hemel Hempstead to 35 per cent in
8889,Basildon and 55 per cent in Hatfield
8890,with an average of about 30 per cent
8891,- rather less than in the country as a whole .
8892,The figures for Corby and Peterlee
8893,( where the prime need so far has
8894,been to provide employment for
8895,women and girls ) are 82 per cent
8896,and 74 per cent respectively .
8897,Shopping provision in the new towns
8898,has generally been based on an
8899,estimated need of about eight
8900,"shops for every thousand people ,"

8916,on the town centres with a

8937,experienced in commercial
8938,development who have undertaken

9034,"Except at Hemel Hempstead , large office"

9039,"There is evidence of greater interest today ,"
9040,with nearly half a million square feet of

9042,much as the total area so far completed .
9043,This interest is likely to grow as employers become

9206,Unless it is known at what oxygen potential a given
9207,material in the sodium coolant circuit will start to
9208,oxidise the cell can only be used as has been
9209,"suggested above , as an oxygen concentration monitor ."
9210,"However , if a material oxidizes in sodium at a given"
9211,oxygen potential the reference electrode could be held
9212,at that potential and oxidizing or reducing conditions
9213,in the coolant circuit for that material would be
9214,indicated by a negative or positive potential at the
9215,reference electrode .
9216,Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium
9217,circuit a corrosion indicator could be a reference
9218,electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated
9219,with niobium separated from the coolant by a
9220,solid anionic electrolyte . A negative voltage from
9221,the reference electrode would mean oxidizing
9222,"conditions for niobium and positive voltage , non-"
9223,oxidizing conditions . The practical application of
9224,the above idea will involve considerable experimenta-
9225,tion before it can be realised .
9226,The first requirement is for an anionic
9227,"electrolyte , which can be fabricated into"
9228,suitable shapes impervious to gases and
9229,liquid sodium and which is neither
9230,corroded by sodium nor by sodium
9231,monoxide . Possible materials are zirconia
9232,stabilised with lime and thoria doped
9233,with rare earth oxides .
9234,Provided the temperatures at C and E are
9235,"the same , thermoelectric contributions to the"
9236,voltage should be zero . The probe extends
9237,out of the sodium stream through a close
9238,fitting thin walled T-Junction F and passes
9239,into the open via a water-cooled O ring seal G .
9240,The open end of the probe is sealed with
9241,a vacuum coupling H which also positions
9242,the +ve nickel conductor with respect
9243,to the sodium by circlips on either side
9244,of the seal I .
9245,Evaporation of sodium from the pool C is
9246,minimised by a close fitting cylindrical
9247,block of electrolyte J attached to the +ve nickel
9248,conductor by nickel circlips . Fixing and
9249,positioning of the probe relative to the coolant
9250,stream is effected by tie-bars of insulating
9251,material K joining the vacuum coupling H to the
9252,water cooled flange G .
9253,The probe can be evacuated and filled with inert gas
9254,via the tube L which must of course be electrically
9255,isolated after this has been carried out . It is not
9256,suggested that the above proposal will be successful
9257,but rather that it is worth a trial in the event of
9258,the inadequacy of some simpler method of
9259,monitoring the oxygen in a sodium circuit . The
9260,"principal difficulty encountered by the author , in"
9261,determining partial molal free energies by solid
9262,"electrolyte cells of very stable oxides such as UO2 ,"
9263,MnO etc. was vapour phase transfer of oxygen by
9264,carbonaceous impurities in the blanket gas .
9265,This resulted in the oxidation of the
9266,-ve electrode and reduction of the +ve
9267,electrode which of course led to a loss in
9268,E.M.F. from the cell . In the above design the two
9269,electrodes are completely separated from one
9270,another so that this major source of
9271,trouble should not be present .
9272,The presence of 75 of bismuth-210 is equivalent to
9273,ingrowth over two half-lives ( ten days ) . Therefore
9274,"after a further forty days , the bismuth daughter"
9275,will be within 0.1 sources are required for use sooner
9276,"than forty or fifty days after preparation , the"
9277,lead-210 together with added lead carrier must
9278,be separated from the bismuth-210 daughter by
9279,"ion exchange ( see Analytical Method , steps 4 , 5 )"
9280,before precipitating lead chromate .
9281,Knowing the time of separation and the
9282,"activity of the lead-210 solution , the ingrowth"
9283,of the bismuth-210 can be calculated . The
9284,absolute activity of the reference standards
9285,can be calculated from the known activity
9286,of the lead-210 solution and the chemical
9287,"yield , but this calculation is unnecessary"
9288,provided the same lead carrier solution is
9289,used to prepare the reference standards
9290,and for the analyses .
9291,Only the weights of the recovered lead chromate
9292,precipitates need be known because the concentration
9293,of the lead carrier solution cancels out of the
9294,algebraic equations . An effort was made to
9295,detect the presence of any radioactive impurities in
9296,the tracer by separating the lead-210 and the
9297,bismuth-210 by anion exchange . The 15b-counting
9298,of the lead-210 fraction began within a few
9299,minutes of completing the separation .
9300,The ingrowth of bismuth-210 was followed
9301,for ten days and showed no abnormalities .
9302,Any impurity in the lead fraction must ha-
9303,ve been well below one percent . Some separa-
9304,ted lead-210 was used to make reference stan-
9305,dards and as a tracer in recovery experiments .
9306,There was no significant difference between the-
9307,se results and those obtained using the original
9308,lead-210 solution supplied by the Radiochemical
9309,Centre which we concluded was radiochemi-
9310,cally pure .
9311,Rosenquist ( 4 ) showed that minute quantities of
9312,lead can be isolated from large volumes of solu-
9313,tion by coprecipitating the lead with a strontium
9314,sulphate . Lead and strontium form mixed cry-
9315,stals so that the more insoluble lead sulphate
9316,is almost completely recovered even if precipitation
9317,of the strontium sulphate is incomplete . Using
9318,ten milligrams of lead carrier and six
9319,"hundred milligrams of strontium per liter ,"
9320,more than 95 experiment .
9321,Absorption of the beta particles is also kept to a
9322,minimum but the accuracy and precision of
9323,weighing the precipitated sources suffers . All
9324,precipitates were weighed on a semi-micro balance
9325,which had been calibrated with a set of certificated
9326,weights from the National Physical Laboratory .
9327,Complete chemical exchange between the
9328,radio-lead and the added lead carrier is
9329,necessary if the analytical results are to
9330,be correct .
9331,"In the preliminary experiments , the tracer was added to a"
9332,liter of effluent and immediately coprecipitated with
9333,strontium sulphate from hot solution . Chemical exchange
9334,was complete under these conditions ; but when the tracer
9335,was added to alkaline effluent and allowed to
9336,stand for several days before the addition of lead
9337,"carrier , the recovery of lead-210 was as much as five"
9338,per cent low when corrected for gravimetric recovery
9339,of the carrier .
9340,The presence and growth of algae in the
9341,alkaline effluent does not prevent the
9342,recovery of radio-lead under the prescribed
9343,conditions although some radioactivity remains
9344,on the algae until the metathesis has been
9345,completed by heating the mixed sulphates
9346,with three separate portions of dilute ( 1.25
9347,normal ) sodium carbonate solution . The
9348,strength of the carbonate solution was
9349,chosen after experiments with lead tracer
9350,alone which indicated that less lead was
9351,A small manual coffee grinder is useful as the resin
9352,cannot be ground with a mortar and pestle . The
9353,sieved resin is washed repeatedly with distilled water
9354,to remove fines and then with hydrochloric acid to
9355,convert the resin completely to the chloride form .
9356,The 60-100 mesh resin is again washed with water to
9357,remove the acid and finally dried in air .
9358,The glass tube is 11 cm. long and 1 cm. in internal
9359,diameter . One end of the tube is drawn down to a fine
9360,tip and a B14 conical glass socket is fitted to the
9361,other end as shown in Figure 1 . The reservoir is a 50 ml
9362,cylindrical separating funnel with a capillary tap
9363,modified by the addition of a B14 cone to fit the
9364,glass column .
9365,The exact volume of the eluting agents must be found by
9366,experiment for each batch of resin using radioactive tracer
9367,"( lead-210 , bismuth-210 ) . A typical elution curve is shown in"
9368,"Figure 3 . Once these volumes have been established , the weight"
9369,of resin used is also fixed . All available evidence indicates
9370,that the fractions containing lead and bismuth are free
9371,of cross contamination apart from the natural
9372,ingrowth of the daughters arising from the decay of
9373,lead .
9374,Polonium-210 remains on the column and does not
9375,interfere . Strontium does not form a chloro-complex
9376,and therefore passes through in the feed solution and
9377,the first wash . The resin is used for a single
9378,separation and then thrown away . In the first stage
9379,"of the analysis , only the fraction containing"
9380,lead-210 is collected . The lead is precipitated as
9381,"the chromate , washed , slurried onto an aluminium"
9382,"counting tray , dried under an infra-red lamp ,"
9383,"weighed , and set aside for five days while the"
9384,bismuth-210 grows in .
9385,"At the end of five days , bismuth-210 will have"
9386,reached one-half of its equilibrium value and
9387,can be counted through an aluminium absorber
9388,sufficiently thick to stop the beta particles
9389,from lead-210 and the alpha particles from
9390,polonium-210 .
9391,During the first few hours the curve will be
9392,distorted if activity other than bismuth-
9393,210 is present . These bismuth nuclides may
9394,include : together with their lead parents .
9395,All but lead-212 will decay completely
9396,within six hours . The decay of lead-212
9397,will distort the observed activity for
9398,hour and a half days if it is
9399,present .
9400,"If there is sufficient beta activity , the radioche-"
9401,mical purity of the Bi-210 may be checked
9402,by observing the decay curve . The removal of lead
9403,chromate from the aluminium counting tray together
9404,with the bismuth-210 prior to the second ion
9405,exchange separation has been checked by
9406,counting the trays . Not more than 0.2 of the
9407,bismuth-210 remains on the tray after the
9408,acid wash .
9409,This loss is acceptably small for an analytical
9410,step when no correction for carrier
9411,recovery is possible . The completeness
9412,of the chemical exchange between the
9413,bismuth-210 and the added carrier was
9414,also tested . Two samples of precipitated
9415,"lead chromate ( lead-210 , bismuth-210 )"
9416,were counted and dissolved in nitric
9417,acid in silica basins . The contents
9418,were evaporated to dryness with
9419,bismuth carrier and then taken up in
9420,The bismuth was recovered from the eluate as the
9421,phosphate . Results did not differ from those obtained by the more
9422,convenient method of heating the dissolved chro-
9423,mates in 2 N hydrochloric acid for fifteen minutes . The more
9424,rigorous method of securing chemical exchange was unnecessary .
9425,Lead-210 when present in effluent is likely to be found
9426,only at very low concentrations .
9427,Table 1 shows the decontamination factors
9428,"obtained experimentally for ten radionuclides ,"
9429,accompanied in two instances by radioactive dau-
9430,ghters . The decontamination factor falls below
9431,104 only for Ruthenium-106 and zirconium-95
9432,"with their daughters in the first stage , i.e."
9433,the lead chromate source containing the bismuth-
9434,21 daughter . When the second stage ( the bismuth
9435,"phosphate source ) is completed , the decontami-"
9436,nation factors are exceptionally high .
9437,A known quantity ( approx. 1 x 10-2 15mc ) of
9438,lead-210 was added to 1-litre aliquots
9439,of different batches of typical low-activity
9440,effluent . The aliquots were allowed to
9441,stand for about seven days ( except
9442,where noted to the contrary ) before lead
9443,carrier was added and the analytical
9444,procedure begun .
9445,"All stages of Calanus , for example ,"
9446,seem to migrate on some occasions while
9447,any stage may not on others . Such data
9448,cannot yet be rationalized . Where
9449,"information is less extensive , however , it is"
9450,possible to find some regularity in the
9451,observations . Thus in Euphausia superba
9452,"from the Antarctic , the metanauplii remain"
9453,"in deep water , the later larval stages"
9454,"migrate diurnally , and the adolescents"
9455,stay permanently at the surface .
9456,The migrating stages all come from 100-250
9457,"meters , and the time of their arrival at"
9458,the surface is directly related to their
9459,swimming capacity : 3rd ( oldest )
9460,"calyptopis from 1800-2200 hr ; 2nd ,"
9461,"from 2200-0200 hr ; and 1st , from 0200-0600 hr ."
9462,Similar ontogenetic differences are apparent
9463,in Bosmina coregoni whose adults remain
9464,at the surface while the young migrate
9465,to and from a depth of 50 meters .
9466,Such permanent occurrence at the surface
9467,could of course be considered the extreme
9468,of a variable day depth . The effect of
9469,day depths upon the surfacing of various
9470,animals has been reviewed elsewhere . c .
9471,Anomalies . In spite of the variability
9472,"of migrational behavior , some kinds"
9473,of anomalies may be recognized .
9474,Vertical movement occurs in some forms
9475,apparently in the reverse manner to
9476,that commonly met .
9477,Such reversed migrations are known for
9478,"Acartia clausi , A. longiremis , Nyctiphanes"
9479,"couchii , Evadne sp. , Oithona nana , Daphnia"
9480,"lumholzi , Stages 4 , 5 , and adult of"
9481,"Calanus finmarchicus , Diaptomus banforanus ,"
9482,and Cyclops bicuspidatus . An echo-producing
9483,"layer , which the authors think probably consists"
9484,"of euphausiids , has also been described"
9485,"as , in part , regularly moving in a reverse"
9486,manner . Most of these records are well
9487,substantiated and involve whole populations
9488,rather than aberrant individuals .
9489,But normal movements have been
9490,reported also for the same species in
9491,the case of five of these examples
9492,and for other species in the same
9493,"genera for the remaining Evadne ,"
9494,"Daphnia , and Diaptomus . Many"
9495,forms sometimes migrate and on other
9496,"occasions do not , but a few"
9497,appear to remain permanently at
9498,one level . Considering the widespread
9499,incidence of migration in the
9500,The most clearly substantiated case
9501,is that of the copepod Anomalocera
9502,"patersoni , which remains permanently"
9503,at the surface . Among other copepods
9504,"Rhincalanus gigas , Calanoides acutus ,"
9505,"Microcalanus pygmaeus , Oithona"
9506,"frigida , and Centropages typicus are"
9507,reported as showing no migration .
9508,The predaceous cladoceran Bythotrephes
9509,longimanus also remains at one
9510,"level , about 10 meters down ."
9511,In view of its well-known normal
9512,"migration , the occurrence of Calanus"
9513,finmarchicus in the summer at
9514,the surface in bright sunlight
9515,may justly be considered anomalous .
9516,This phenomenon has nevertheless been
9517,"recorded many times , and such"
9518,surface Calanus may be present in
9519,"enormous numbers , breaking the surface"
9520,into small circular ripples like
9521,It seems likely that a continuous
9522,interchange was taking place between
9523,the population at the surface and
9524,that in deeper water . A second
9525,group whose normal vertical
9526,migration is sufficiently well
9527,known to make daytime
9528,occurrence at the surface
9529,rank as anomalous is the
9530,Euphausiacea . There are numerous
9531,records of euphausiids swimming
9532,2 . Mechanisms . The majority of
9533,vertical migrations undoubtedly
9534,result from active swimming
9535,although passive movement through
9536,the water has been suggested on
9537,"various grounds . For example ,"
9538,transport in vertical currents
9539,resulting from temperature diff-
9540,erences has been proposed ; diff-
9541,erences in water viscosity after
9542,temperature changes have also been
9543,Downward movement may in some forms
9544,"start as a passive sinking , especially"
9545,when it occurs before dawn ; but this
9546,must almost certainly be replaced
9547,by the headfirst downward swimming
9548,"observed in the field . 3 . Initiating ,"
9549,"controlling , and orienting factors . The"
9550,primary dependence of diurnal
9551,migrations upon changes in light intensity
9552,is beyond doubt . Yet in spite
9553,"of a great amount of work ,"
9554,Loeb first suggested the importance
9555,of light as the governing factor
9556,but combined its influence with that
9557,"of gravity . Later authors , in particular"
9558,"Rose , have proposed that light"
9559,alone can provide an adequate
9560,"mechanism if the animals have ,"
9561,"and select by exploration , a"
9562,zone of optimum light intensity .
9563,This view has been enlarged
9564,with a suggestion that both
9565,This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be
9566,obtained with tubular constructions . The growth of the
9567,aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need
9568,"for lightweight compact heat exchangers . During the 1930's ,"
9569,the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction
9570,"became established for aero-engine radiators , using"
9571,dip-soldered copper . The air and engine-coolant passages
9572,were separated by flat plates .
9573,The air passages were packed with corrugated
9574,foil bonded to the primary plates to
9575,provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer .
9576,"The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil ,"
9577,chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to withstand
9578,the coolant pressure loadings . The introduction of the aluminium alloy
9579,dip-brazing process in the early 1940's was quickly taken up
9580,for aircraft heat exchangers and led to substantial
9581,weight reductions as compared with copper construction .
9582,This development coincided with the introduction of
9583,pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air
9584,cabin coolers . Although in this case the heat transfer
9585,coefficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger
9586,"were of comparable magnitude , the use of"
9587,"secondary surface was still attractive , since the"
9588,greater part of the surface area could be made up
9589,of fins only 0.006 in. ( 0.15 mm. ) thick .
9590,"Furthermore , developments in the detail form of"
9591,the fins made possible a reduction in the total
9592,surface area required as compared with the use of
9593,smooth continuous passages for the same thermal
9594,duty and pressure losses . The properties of
9595,"compact form , low weight , and design flexibility"
9596,thus developed found ready application on a
9597,much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage
9598,scale air separation plants .
9599,The basic method of construction is both simple and
9600,extremely flexible . Figure 3 illustrates the
9601,arrangement of a single passage . This can be
9602,extended in length and width up to the limit of
9603,manufacturing equipment available . The corrugation
9604,"is machine-formed , thus ensuring a high standard"
9605,of uniformity in height and fin pitch .
9606,"Though that was not quite the phrase , for even"
9607,"if he could succeed Sir Charles he would , as"
9608,"an executive , be eternally differentiated from"
9609,the Governors . Fairbanks managed the Governors
9610,"beautifully , he knew more than they , he was"
9611,"cleverer than most , discreetly used their Christian"
9612,names - but remained their servant . They had
9613,"no office hours , however elastic ; their lives were"
9614,spent in committee making decisions for others
9615,to execute on the basis of data laboriously
9616,"The gin pahits , and now the beer with the"
9617,"curry , had their desired effect on us ;"
9618,"or rather , on Nigel and myself . Lee , I"
9619,"noticed , had asked for Coca-Cola . This"
9620,rather surprised me from a young man
9621,who was otherwise so sophisticated . He
9622,"was not , however , ostentatious about"
9623,the matter .
9624,"If anything , he had merely become a little more reserved , and"
9625,much more polite . I thought to myself : ' A few years in the
9626,"East , my boy , and you 'll drink - I 've seen your kind be-"
9627,"fore ! ' After the curry , I wanted only to go upstairs to"
9628,"bed . I had long since become accustomed , and now addicted ,"
9629,to an after-curry nap .
9630,Verena Holenstein
9631,"Lee , however , showed not the slightest sign of fatigue . ' I"
9632,"wonder if you 'd mind if I took a bit of a look round , '"
9633,"he asked Nigel . ' I don't sleep in the afternoons . ' Nigel ,"
9634,"I must say , was very good about it . I knew how much"
9635,"he probably wanted to sleep himself . But , almost"
9636,"gallantly , he said :"
9637,"' Not at all . I 'll show you . ' ' Oh no , '"
9638,"young Lee protested , considerate as always ."
9639,"' That 's not necessary if you want to rest , sir ."
9640,I 'm sure I won't do any harm . ' Nigel
9641,laughed . I had not known he was so
9642,"good-natured . But then , I suppose I had"
9643,never given him similar cause to display
9644,such amiability .
9645,"I slept soundly , and much later than I should . It"
9646,"was already after six when I awoke , and the sun"
9647,was nearly setting beyond the west window .
9648,"Downstairs I could hear the murmur of voices ,"
9649,"and knew they were back . I wondered , as I"
9650,"wrapped a 6sarong around my waist , if"
9651,Nigel at all resented being deprived of his
9652,afternoon sleep .
9653,"And I said to myself : Oh , God , doesn't the"
9654,boy ever relax ! He turned his gaze away
9655,"from me almost instantly , but it had"
9656,been enough to make me conscious of the
9657,"nakedness of the upper half of my body , even"
9658,of the matted grey hairs on my chest . He
9659,probably thought my appearance quite a breach
9660,"of the social graces ; but , naturally , he said"
9661,not so much as a word about it .
9662,"' We 've just had tea , ' Nigel said . ' Would you like"
9663,the cookie to make you a fresh lot ? ' ' I 'd rather
9664,"have whisky , ' I told him . ' Thought as much ."
9665,"Sun 's nearly below the yard-arm , anyway ."
9666,Wouldn't mind a stengah myself . How about
9667,"you , Harry ? ' So they had managed to come"
9668,to the stage of using each other's Christian
9669,"names , I noted ."
9670,Perhaps Lee wasn't quite as
9671,"reserved as I thought . ' Thanks ,"
9672,"Nigel , ' he said . ' Just Coca-Cola ."
9673,Although I 'd like to have
9674,whatever you have . I want to
9675,get to know the kind of life
9676,"people lead in the East , you know . '"
9677,"At this , I felt a return of the"
9678,irritation I felt with him
9679,at times .
9680,"Knowing Nigel , I would have been surprised if he"
9681,had not made his usual ' arrangements ' . A bachelor
9682,"himself , he knew well how to entertain his bachelor"
9683,friends . He caught my look and pursed his lips in
9684,a quick little grimace of acknowledgement ; then raised
9685,an enquiring eyebrow in young Lee's direction .
9686,I shrugged a shoulder . Lee would have
9687,"to decide about that for himself , I"
9688,"thought , and noticed that although he"
9689,"was looking at the other girl , he did"
9690,"so quite dispassionately , almost as though"
9691,he was merely interested in the unfamiliar
9692,clothes she was wearing . And I thought
9693,to myself : He may be still too much of
9694,a ' new chum ' to see ' the beauty of
9695,the East ' .
9696,"There was still an ease in our conversation , but its"
9697,scope was restricted . I felt that I could hardly make the
9698,usual enquiries and comments about Nigel's various mistresses
9699,"as I was accustomed to whenever I saw him , much as I"
9700,wondered which of his girls was in favour at the moment .
9701,"And I suppose he felt the same . We had only a few drinks ,"
9702,then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early
9703,dinner .
9704,He had one of the better Kashmir carpets on
9705,"the floor . His pictures and curtains , indeed I"
9706,"suppose the entire furnishings , had been se-"
9707,"lected personally . The house was , as he"
9708,"occasionally proclaimed , his home - and he had"
9709,made it as such . I doubt if he will ever
9710,"leave Malaya , even when he retires ."
9711,"The country , and his mistresses , have come"
9712,"to mean too much to him . And , indirectly ,"
9713,this impression I had of him was one of several
9714,reasons why I had decided I should leave
9715,"it - before , for me too , it would be too late ."
9716,I used the excuse of our early start in the
9717,morning to retire as soon as it seemed
9718,"prudent to do so , after the coffee and brandy ,"
9719,already anticipating the familiar pleasures
9720,awaiting me .
9721,After lunch two of the Prime Minister's
9722,"grandchildren who had sat , rather intimidated"
9723,by Ormston and staring at the Grinling
9724,"Gibbons carving around the fireplace , rose"
9725,"gratefully from the table , leaving the two"
9726,"men together . A nurse came in , and asked"
9727,the Prime Minister if he wanted to be
9728,"helped out on to the lawn , but he waved"
9729,her away impatiently .
9730,I don't mean just our direct military costs . I 'm
9731,thinking of the African Boycott which is already working up .
9732,"I 'm afraid , Prime Minister , you 're not going to like the"
9733,"trading position when you see it . ' ' I never do , ' the"
9734,Prime Minister commented wearily . The Chancellor
9735,was repeating an argument which he had already
9736,developed for an hour before lunch .
9737,"' It comes at a bad time , ' said"
9738,Ormston . ' A singularly bad time . The
9739,"Party 's very restless , you know . ' ' It"
9740,is a sign of life - very encouraging ! '
9741,' The younger men - ' ' Which ones ? '
9742,"' The younger ones like Gore , Vaughan ,"
9743,"Hadley , Prebble , Lambert-Price - the"
9744,New Africa lot - ' ' Do they confide
9745,in you ? Have you spoken to them ? '
9746,"' Only at yesterday's meeting - they 're very restless , Prime"
9747,Minister . They feel that it 's very old-fashioned - shooting
9748,down mobs of natives . They 're very much afraid that
9749,if the Opposition get a Commission of Enquiry some
9750,rather dismal stuff is going to come out . '
9751,' Young back-benchers are always restive when they 're
9752,"bored , ' said the Prime Minister , and for the first"
9753,"time since his grandchildren left the table , he smiled ."
9754,' Why don't you give them something to play with ? '
9755,"' They 've found their own toy , ' said Ormston ,"
9756,' and this is it . They want to abstain next week . '
9757,The Prime Minister continued in his flippant
9758,"tone , ' Tell the Chief to give them a"
9759,"talking-to . ' The Chancellor closed his eyes ,"
9760,"and then said ,"
9761,"' I think it 's gone beyond that , Prime Minister ."
9762,They feel pretty strongly about Africa . They are greatly
9763,disturbed by the new and rather ugly image of
9764,the Party which our African policy is creating .
9765,"On the whole , the country is still in favour"
9766,of moderation and common sense . Melville has
9767,in a curious way made us look old-fashioned
9768,- extravagant - nineteenth centuryish -
9769,almost cranky . '
9770,"The Prime Minister looked puzzled , and said , ' Julia Drayford ? How"
9771,does she come into it ? I can't follow these complexities - ' ' It isn't
9772,quite that . The whole business blew up from Melville's disgraceful
9773,indiscretion to Julia Drayford in Mrs. M'landa's presence .
9774,I don't know the exact chain of gossip or who told who
9775,what .
9776,"As he turned aside his head , since he could not"
9777,"bear to look at her beautiful , pleading face , he was"
9778,suddenly attacked by suspicion . ' You wish to marry
9779,someone else ! ' he cried in a voice roughened by
9780,"jealousy . She sighed deeply , and looked away . ' Do you ?"
9781,"Do you ? ' he repeated , fiercely ."
9782,"' If , ' she said gently , giving him a look that set his pulses throbbing ,"
9783,"' if I wished to marry some young gallant , do you think I would"
9784,ask your help ? You would be the last man I would ask . ' Before
9785,"he could collect his wits to reply to this , there was a bustle"
9786,and confusion at the end of the room . Prince Doria had
9787,wearied of his toy and was packing it away in its painted
9788,coffer .
9789,The party was now preparing to see
9790,"the tapestries , and in the general"
9791,"movement , Vittoria was separated from"
9792,Orsini . Although neither of them
9793,"wished to follow the sightseers , there seemed"
9794,no alternative . As she was about to mount
9795,a wide and shallow flight of marble
9796,"stairs , she became aware of someone"
9797,"watching her intently , and turning"
9798,"in that direction , she saw Olimpia ,"
9799,"standing beside her admirer , Orlando Cavalcanti ."
9800,The young man was bending over her with the
9801,"assiduity of a lover , but the girl appeared to be more"
9802,"interested in her cousin's wife , whom she was regarding"
9803,through half-closed eyes . This was a slight shock to
9804,"Vittoria , who had forgotten the existence of the girl ,"
9805,"and , up to this moment had been unaware of the"
9806,young man's presence at the palazzo .
9807,"' Are you enjoying yourself , Olimpia ? ' she"
9808,"asked idly , tapping the girl's cheek lightly with"
9809,"her fan , in passing ; but she did not wait for"
9810,"the answer . Disturbed by vague uneasiness , she"
9811,was wondering whether Olimpia had been
9812,watching her talk with Orsini . Surely she
9813,could not have overheard anything they
9814,said ? A moment's reflection reassured her
9815,"on that point , for she was certain no one"
9816,had been standing near them .
9817,"However , something inimical in the girl's look"
9818,put Vittoria on guard . ' Santa Maria ! These spying
9819,"eyes ! ' she thought , bitterly . Doria was continually"
9820,"stopping on the way , to point out , with childish pride ,"
9821,"objects of beauty or interest . Vittoria , on the"
9822,"fringe of the party , caught snatches of this"
9823,"information , which held no interest for her :"
9824,' ... now this sapphire ...
9825,I like to think it may have fallen from the dark
9826,"hair of the Empress Messalina , as she crouched"
9827,"in terror in the gardens of Lucullus , awaiting the"
9828,sword of the executioner . ' ' Ah ! ' exclaimed
9829,"Farnese , with a snigger . ' The old cuckold"
9830,"Claudius had the last word , after all . He"
9831,"knew how to deal with an adulterous wife ,"
9832,"eh , Orsini ? '"
9833,"If the duke made any reply to this , Vittoria did"
9834,not hear it . Now they entered the long gallery
9835,"where they dispersed and wandered around , admiring"
9836,and commenting on the glowing hues and barbaric
9837,splendours of the tapestries Doria had brought
9838,"back from Lepanto . After a short interval , Orsini"
9839,found an opportunity to rejoin Vittoria .
9840,"' We must talk further , ' he said in a low"
9841,urgent voice . ' Where ? '
9842,"' Be careful , ' she whispered from behind her fan ."
9843,' Olimpia is watching us . The young man with her is
9844,"Orlando Cavalcanti , Francesco's friend . ' Orsini"
9845,shot an impatient glance at the couple . ' The young man
9846,"with the mole ? ' ' Yes , indeed . ' ' No matter . They are not"
9847,"looking at us . Now I must know , ' he whispered , ' what"
9848,"you meant , cara mia . Do you want your freedom in order"
9849,to marry ? '
9850,"Before replying to this , she glanced"
9851,"hastily around , then spoke in tones so low that he"
9852,had to bend his head to hear : ' I will never be
9853,any man's mistress . As to marrying again ...
9854,if I were free ... there is only one man I would
9855,"wish to marry ... but ... he , like myself , is now"
9856,bound . '
9857,With a swift gesture she closed her fan
9858,and moved away from him towards the group
9859,"in the centre of the gallery , leaving him standing"
9860,"alone , against that glowing , barbaric background ,"
9861,with a deeply thoughtful expression on his face .
9862,On a bright unclouded morning a few days after
9863,"the visit to the Doria Palace , the cardinal's"
9864,"coach left the villa , lurched over the unpaved"
9865,track and turned towards the ruined Baths
9866,of Diocletian .
9867,"Vittoria , accompanied by her maid , Lucia , was on her"
9868,"way to the Accoramboni villa , ostensibly to pay"
9869,"a daughterly call on her father , actually to coax"
9870,money from that indulgent parent to settle her mounting
9871,debts . Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress
9872,"looked , and how cunningly the olive-green dress"
9873,with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her
9874,perfect figure . Vittoria's thoughts were more complex .
9875,"The sparkling society of the Doria Palace , the flattery"
9876,"of Orsini's obsession , the thwarted ambitions of her"
9877,"restless spirit , all threw into sharp relief the contrast"
9878,of her grey life with the splendid one that filled
9879,"her dreams . At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien ,"
9880,and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco
9881,"to give her a separate establishment , he invariably"
9882,"pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle , who"
9883,had built the villa for his family .
9884,He reminded her that they must abide by Roman
9885,"custom , and dwell there with their relations . Her"
9886,values were those of the materialist who assesses
9887,"every human being in terms of fame , power and"
9888,"wealth . Francesco she despised for his dullness , his"
9889,"lack of initiative , his subservience to his uncle ."
9890,"Her husband's gentleness and amiability , his unselfish"
9891,"love for her , she regarded as signs of weakness . He was a"
9892,futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving
9893,her a child . Whatever passion she had experienced in the
9894,first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt .
9895,She had never loved him . Her thoughts rushed to Orsini .
9896,"Since the meeting in the Doria Palace , no word had"
9897,"come from him , and this silence oppressed her spirits"
9898,with a weight of misgiving .
9899,"She had , perhaps , demanded too much . The"
9900,kiss in the garden had plumbed unsus-
9901,"pected depths in her , and she knew that"
9902,"if she yielded to him , her passion could ,"
9903,"indeed , match his . Every instinct urged her to"
9904,"surrender , for there was that in his nature"
9905,to which her own had responded as it
9906,had responded to no other human being .
9907,"Prudence , ambition and reason had"
9908,"held instinct in check , and they must"
9909,dictate her course . There could be no
9910,compromise . For a brief interval
9911,she allowed herself the luxury of
9912,dreams . She began to imagine life at
9913,"Bracciano , the balls and fe*?5tes , the"
9914,conversation of poets and dilettanti . She
9915,visualized the pageantry of the tourna-
9916,"ment , and herself on the ducal dais beside"
9917,"Orsini , placing a chaplet of roses on the brows"
9918,This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a
9919,"sickening jolt and came to an abrupt stop , nearly throwing"
9920,the two girls from their seats . Lucia uttered a cry of
9921,"alarm . ' Look , madonna , we are surrounded ! ' It was true ."
9922,Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about
9923,"them and a lean , swarthy fellow was peering through"
9924,"the window , grinning impudently . ' Santa Maria ! '"
9925,shrieked Lucia . ' Banditti ! '
9926,Vittoria now realized that they were outside
9927,"Santa Maria degli Angeli , and that except for a few beggars"
9928,crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting
9929,"loathsome sores , the area was deserted . ' They are not banditti ,"
9930,"Lucia , ' said Vittoria , pointing to the badge on the man's"
9931,shoulder . The words were clear . ' Beware my hug ! ' Lucia
9932,stared speechlessly at the golden bear ; Vittoria swiftly
9933,averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance
9934,of the retainer .
9935,Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic . The
9936,"coach now turned in another direction , towards"
9937,the wild and desolate region behind the baths .
9938,"It was sparsely inhabited , dotted with fallow fields"
9939,"and terraced vineyards , and here and there jutted"
9940,"a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins , a pathetic"
9941,reminder of Rome's former greatness .
9942,In this region of Monti most of the public baths
9943,"had been built in the time of the Caesars , but with the"
9944,breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions
9945,the baths had lost their purpose ; they had become
9946,stone quarries and their precious marble had been
9947,burnt for lime . Now escaped criminals and bandits
9948,"used these quarries as hiding places , to the danger"
9949,of travellers in the district .
9950,"As they lumbered past at a rattling pace , Vittoria"
9951,could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a
9952,gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures
9953,"gathered about it , cooking their frugal meal . These"
9954,were left far behind . An old man belabouring an
9955,"overladen donkey , and a withered crone appeared"
9956,"on the horizon , were overtaken and forgotten ."
9957,"Except for their escort , Vittoria and"
9958,Lucia might have been the only living
9959,creatures on an empty planet . After the
9960,"initial shock , Vittoria felt calm . She"
9961,"knew exactly what she wanted , and"
9962,"was prepared to take it without scruple ,"
9963,if she could . What she had forgotten
9964,in her self-absorption in her own schemes
9965,was that other people were equally absorbed
9966,"in their schemes , which were likely to"
9967,run counter to her own .
9968,This move today was a reminder of that fact .
9969,Whilst she automatically patted the hand of
9970,"the agitated Lucia , her brain was working"
9971,"rapidly , and she decided that she must be"
9972,"prepared to counter Orsini's demands ,"
9973,difficult though that would be . She became
9974,aware that the pace was slackening ;
9975,now the coach stopped .
9976,The moment had come . Upon the ensuing interview
9977,"the future would depend . Outwardly she was calm , but"
9978,"her heart was beating fast , and the palms of her"
9979,hands were damp . Orsini's high-crowned hat with
9980,its jaunty plume blotted out the light ; his hand
9981,was on the door . Glancing at Lucia he said in
9982,French to Vittoria : ' Your maid ... is she reliable ? '
9983,"She shrugged her shoulders , and replied in the same"
9984,language : ' Yes . But make it worth her while . '
9985,"' I see . I know how to deal with people like that , '"
9986,"and turning to the cowering Lucia , he spoke in her"
9987,"own language . ' Do you know who I am ? ' ' No ,"
9988,"signor , ' she whispered . ' I am the Orsini . My word is"
9989,law in Rome . '
9990,Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat .
9991,"Thrusting his head farther into the coach , he said"
9992,sombrely : ' Have you ever heard of a punishment called
9993,the cord ? ' She blanched and shrank away . Was there not
9994,a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda
9995,"where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty , fifty ,"
9996,"sixty feet into the air , and dropped again and again , until"
9997,their arms were wrenched from their sockets . ' You have
9998,heard of it ?
9999,The Orsini give that to traitors . There is
10000,no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini . We hunt
10001,"a traitor down to the ends of the earth , and no"
10002,power can save him ... or her . Do you understand ? '
10003,"' Yes , signor , ' she faltered . ' On the other hand , ' he"
10004,"continued , giving her a keen look , ' the Orsini are"
10005,generous to those who serve them faithfully .
10006,"Remember that , my girl . ' Lucia was beyond"
10007,"speech . He turned to Vittoria , sitting erect ,"
10008,with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with
10009,"anger . ' And now , madonna , ' he said smoothly , ' we will"
10010,continue the conversation started at the Doria
10011,"Palace . Be pleased to alight . ' ' I think , ' she replied"
10012,"coolly , ' I prefer to stay where I am . '"
10013,"' In that case , ' he reverted to French , ' I shall be obliged"
10014,"to lift you from the coach . ' Without answering him , she"
10015,"rose , and bending over the agitated girl , said softly :"
10016,"' No one will harm you , Lucia . Remain here . ' Ignoring his"
10017,"proffered hand , she stepped from the vehicle . ' Will you"
10018,be so good as to order your men not to molest my
10019,"maid , ' she said coldly to Orsini ."
10020,"' She is absolutely safe , ' he replied ; but he turned ,"
10021,"nevertheless , to the man who had peered into the"
10022,"coach , whom he had addressed as Luigi , and gave him sharp"
10023,"instructions on the matter . Vittoria stood looking about her ,"
10024,breathing the scent of thyme . The land at her feet sloped
10025,"away into a tiny valley beyond which , on the crest"
10026,"of a wooded hill-side , the ruins of a small temple"
10027,were etched against the clear blue of the sky .
10028,"He forgot time and place . He , the master , was gently"
10029,"led along erotic paths which he knew existed , but"
10030,had never trodden . He learned how to use his
10031,"hands , how to adore that body without haste , how"
10032,"to caress every inch with his mouth as well , to"
10033,creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost
10034,himself in a rapture of kisses in places he 'd
10035,"dreamed of , where life began to ooze and quickened"
10036,his heart beat to a thunder .
10037,"He looked at her . Head thrown back in a pool of hair ,"
10038,her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her
10039,heart in the full throat . Her mouth did things he
10040,thought no human being could stand without
10041,"dying , but he went on living in an ocean of"
10042,"voluptuousness , that swelled and ebbed over him ,"
10043,"under him , in him and through him ..."
10044,He was having a ball ! He twiddled the TV set with
10045,shaking hands . She sat calmly on the bed smoking
10046,a cigarette . His face was white with two red
10047,blotches . Hers was flushed and lovely . O.K. teacher !
10048,Was that any better ? You know it was ! You don't
10049,"need teaching , only a little coaxing ."
10050,He sat down and ran his finger down along her
10051,spine . Do you love me now ? Like yesterday ! I 'm
10052,extremely fond of you . The fact that you 're beginning
10053,to satisfy my physical wants does not change that .
10054,Before long you 'll give me the satisfaction that 'll set
10055,"me rocking on my feet , but I 'll still be only fond of"
10056,you . But you wouldn't marry me ?
10057,No . I 'm not your type . I 'd make you miserable . I
10058,mean that . I 'd very probably be unfaithful and
10059,"that 'd kill you . Then I 'd be unfaithful too , to teach"
10060,you a lesson . It wouldn't work . You 'd do it to
10061,spite me . I would never do it for that reason .
10062,To me it 'd be immaterial whether you 'd retaliate
10063,or not . You 'd go crazy if that situation arose .
10064,To observe the colour rise in her cheek
10065,"and hear her breath come faster , to see"
10066,the slight beads of sweat come out on
10067,her glistening skin and see her move
10068,with uncontrolled rhythm . To have her twist
10069,in an attempt to receive a caress he was
10070,"purposely withholding , to hear her deep-throated"
10071,moan of full satisfaction and feel her
10072,"shivering , clawing surrender ."
10073,"Not so dusty , she might say afterwards , drawing at"
10074,a cigarette . It 's a wow ! he said . She kissed
10075,him motherly : You just wait till you teach the
10076,girl you really love . He didn't protest any more
10077,to say he loved her because he knew it to
10078,be untrue . Instead he said : Will that be
10079,better ? She nodded :
10080,It 's man's nature to teach and to teach those
10081,we love is double pleasure . And she
10082,might add : And don't forget to leave the
10083,lights on . You lose half the fun when you
10084,fumble in the dark . She had many direct
10085,comments like that . Once she quietly
10086,pushed him back when he kissed her too
10087,fully and too soon :
10088,"Oi , not yet , you oaf . What do you think my"
10089,mouth is ? A billposter's bucket to be
10090,plunged in at random ? He 'd learned to
10091,laugh when something went wrong or the
10092,"situation became ludicrous , as when they"
10093,were both caught in the raw when he 'd
10094,forgotten to lock his door and Derek
10095,had walked in unexpectedly .
10096,They 'd just had time to nip into the
10097,bathroom and stood there shivering for
10098,fifteen minutes while their guest was
10099,smoking a cigarette waiting for him .
10100,At last Derek got tired and left .
10101,"Just in time , erupted Charlie . If he 'd"
10102,stayed any longer I 'd jolly well
10103,have asked him to join us . I 'm so
10104,darned cold I could do with two men .
10105,"You perverted sex-maniac , you wouldn't"
10106,dare . Show me what you can do and
10107,I 'll tell you if you need help .
10108,Once he came back to the subject
10109,of her marriage and asked her why
10110,she was going to marry her sculptor .
10111,"Because I love him , of course ."
10112,What do you think ?
10113,"But he 's a lot older , isn't he ?"
10114,I suppose so . What attracts you ?
10115,It can't be physical ? Of course
10116,not ! I love him for what he is
10117,- he 's so great I 'm a bit scared
10118,of him - a woman must be a bit
10119,scared to be really in love .
10120,That 's why you could never
10121,love me ?
10122,"Correct , ducky ! You just wait till"
10123,you meet the girl who thinks you 're a
10124,god . It 'll make you feel like one !
10125,You think that sculptor 's a god ?
10126,"Perhaps , in a way . All I know is"
10127,that I need him . He kissed the
10128,heart beat in her throat . But how
10129,about the physical side ? You 're
10130,quite an erotic little beast ; can
10131,he satisfy that ?
10132,You youngsters always overestimate
10133,yourselves . You can take it from
10134,me that he can and does . But
10135,even if he were impotent I 'd still
10136,love and want him . There are
10137,sides to me you 'll never know .
10138,Don't you feel guilty living with
10139,me ? Often ! Don't you ? Mary had
10140,married her bill broker some time
10141,ago and he now shuddered when he
10142,remembered the clinical weekends
10143,he used to spend with her .
10144,He often used to try to imagine
10145,her reactions if he had once treated
10146,"her as he did Charlie , but his"
10147,imagination failed . The efficient
10148,little Mary would probably have
10149,called it a shocking waste of time
10150,and told him to get down to
10151,"business ! Charlie , who was perfectly"
10152,at home at all sorts of artistic
10153,"circles , had amongst others wangled"
10154,him a membership ticket for a
10155,small club for artists only .
10156,He did well . He got in touch with
10157,the woman Pete was passing off as his
10158,mother . Starmouth managed to
10159,win her confidence . It seems that
10160,"she was an honest enough woman ,"
10161,only her mind wasn't as clear as
10162,it could have been . She showed
10163,him photographs . He found out
10164,that the name of her house - Grand
10165,Greve - was taken from a bay
10166,in one of the Channel Islands .
10167,"One of the small ones . Sark , that 's it . The Caxtons"
10168,used to have their holidays there . Starmouth went
10169,there . He dug out some people who remembered
10170,the family . In the end he pieced it all together .
10171,The Caxtons had two boys - Michael and Derek .
10172,Pete first met them at school .
10173,"It was a good school I sent him to , one of the best ."
10174,He was a boarder . He could always turn on the
10175,charm when it suited him . The whole family
10176,came to like him . The real Michael - he was the
10177,same age as my son - died of pleurisy when he
10178,was eighteen . Soon after that Pete staged his
10179,drowning .
10180,He was always a smooth liar . He invented some
10181,plausible story or other and threw himself on
10182,the Caxtons' generosity . They accepted him as a
10183,kind of substitute for the boy they had lost .
10184,Outside the family he began to pass himself
10185,off as Michael Caxton . The father was well-off
10186,and easy-going . He was easy meat for Pete .
10187,He sponged off him until he died
10188,just after the war . Then Pete had to
10189,look around for some other
10190,"security . He found it - Dackson's Wharf ,"
10191,and Dackson's daughter . Mrs. Caxton's
10192,"other boy , Derek , had been killed in the war ."
10193,After her husband died her brain began
10194,to fade . At times she thought Pete was
10195,really her own son .
10196,My chance had come at last . I had to
10197,take it . I was going to smash him as
10198,he had twice tried to smash me . ( His
10199,"eyes , wild and frightened , were fixed on"
10200,Tong . Tong guessed that they did not
10201,see him . ) I told Starmouth to go at
10202,once and report exactly what he had

10207,began by agreeing that she could
10208,have been mistaken about the
10209,precise minute of Dackson's visit
10210,"the previous Wednesday , and ended"
10211,by admitting that he was in fact
10212,at least half an hour late for
10213,"his appointment with her . "" There"

10222,When Nick returned home he found that his
10223,mother was seriously ill . She had pneumonia . The
10224,"sight of her youngest son , the doctor said , was the"
10225,only thing that saved her ; it gave her the strength
10226,she needed to fight for life . Soon she was out of
10227,"danger , but the doctor told Dan that she would"
10228,have to remain in bed for some time and
10229,that thereafter it was essential that she should
10230,not have to exert herself .
10231,With Grace helpless Rose set up her
10232,"own autocracy . Her squeaking , querulous"
10233,accents were heard without inter-
10234,mission . They rose over the baby's inter-
10235,minable howling and were directed at
10236,everyone in equal measure . She was
10237,a poor and unpunctual cook . Normally
10238,"indolent , she was now and again seized"
10239,with unpredictable bouts of energy in
10240,the grip of which she swept through
10241,the house with a fury that disarranged
10242,Only the old man's room was too much for
10243,"her . Once she put her head round the door ,"
10244,"and Sam shouted : "" You get right out of"
10245,"this , Rose . You leave me in peace . """
10246,Rose took one breath of the stagnant air .
10247,""" You - you polecat ! "" she screeched , and"
10248,retreated without argument . Her re*?

10250,produced one extraordinary result .
10251,One day Fred met Nick at the front door as they were both
10252,about to enter the house . Fred grasped his brother's elbow .
10253,""" Nick , I can't stomach this much longer . "" "" Nor me . What 's the"
10254,"answer ? Mum 's picking up , but she 'll never be her old self"

10256,""" That First Flower 's driving me nuts , "" Fred said . "" I 'm going to put"
10257,"a stop to it . """
10258,""" What with - arsenic ? """
10259,"Fred fixed his small eyes on his brother , beckoned"
10260,"him to stand closer , and whispered into his"
10261,ear the most unexpected words Nick had
10262,"ever heard . "" I 'm going to get myself"
10263,"married , "" Fred said . The next day he"
10264,brought home a woman in her middle
10265,thirties and took her straight to his
10266,mother's bedside .
10267,""" Mum , this is Maggie . I 'm going to marry her ,"
10268,"and I 'd like her to come and live with us . """
10269,Maggie was plump and plain with a pleasing
10270,"smile , a placid nature , and a slow-moving"
10271,but methodical mind . For twenty years she
10272,had worked in the bottling-store at the bre-
10273,"wery , and Grace heard with astonishment"
10274,that Fred had known her on and off
10275,for nearly as long .
10276,"It was Nick who found the answer . "" Only"
10277,"one thing for it , Mum , "" he said , sitting on"
10278,the edge of the bed and holding one
10279,"of her hands in his . "" Let Fred and"
10280,Mag have the two upstairs rooms
10281,between them . Sam will have to
10282,come out of his kennel .

10284,"he could be safe from Rose . "" See here , Sam , """
10285,"Nick began . "" You know Fred 's getting spliced . """
10286,""" Gone soft in the head , "" Sam said . "" Same as"
10287,"I 've always said , women rule the roost and"

10290,rattled on very happily .

10292,"do it to me , Nick . I 've worked this room up to"
10293,my way of thinking like I 'd educate a child .
10294,"This room and me understands one another . """
10295,""" Sam , "" Nick said firmly , "" either you and"

10299,"Sam sank back on his pillow . "" Oh , my"
10300,"God ! All right , you win ! "" With that settled"
10301,Fred was soon married . The First Flower
10302,"snatched up her infant and departed , mut-"
10303,tering sarcasms . The whole household
10304,listened to the dwindling screams of the
10305,baby with relief . Maggie soon proved her
10306,"worth , and after a time Dan summed up"
10307,the general approval by saying :

10309,"She speaks our language . Mag 's one of us . """
10310,Nick and his grandfather shared their bedroom

10312,"grumbling rearguard action , permitted himself"
10313,gradually to become a little cleaner and
10314,tidier . In his heart he was well satisfied to
10315,have Nick's company . When they were alone
10316,together he often explained all over again
10317,how shrewd he had been in discovering
10318,Alf Jesty's secret .

10323,ton had some sort of a scar there . Just

10327,""" It certainly was , Sam , "" Nick would agree , and go"
10328,"on to say with a touch of self-importance : "" No"

10330,last summer . Must have thought I 'd
10331,"rumbled him right from the start . "" By this"
10332,time Nick was certain in his own mind
10333,that he had really seen Caxton's hand
10334,snatching at the prop holding the barge's
10335,"hatch open , though he could never prove it ,"
10336,and it would not be of much use if
10337,he could .
10338,The nose is one of the most pain-sensitive
10339,organs in the human body - and
10340,Malone was discovering the truth in
10341,scientific detail . Kennan had only
10342,seconds left . He jumped forward to
10343,"the far limit of his chain , his"
10344,right hand chopping edge-downwards
10345,in bone-jarring force .
10346,The blow took the writhing thug a fraction
10347,above the boney knob which landmarked the cervical
10348,"plexus , the vital nerve-centre which a long-ago"
10349,Marine instructor had declared the pinnacle of unarmed
10350,combat targets . The thug collapsed with a whistling
10351,"moan , and Kennan tore the Luger from the man's"
10352,suddenly limp hand . There was no time for
10353,"rejoicing , but the hard , firm shape of the"
10354,automatic sent a new confidence surging through
10355,his body .
10356,"Shouts , and the clatter of feet meant"
10357,Goldie and Leo Grundy were on their
10358,way . Kennan pulled the manacle chain
10359,"taut , and blasted two shots at the"
10360,link which tied him to the ring-bolt in
10361,the rock . The nine-millimetre bullets sma-
10362,"shed the chain as if it had been plastic ,"
10363,"and , free , though the chain still dangled ,"
10364,he threw himself across the floor
10365,towards the entrance .
10366,"' Well , what do you think ? ' she scoffed , her"
10367,brilliant eyes challenging him . He made no answer .
10368,There was nothing to be said . He lifted his glass
10369,"and drained it , feeling the sweat breaking out on the"
10370,palms of his hands .
10371,When at last he looked up she was standing right
10372,"in front of him , smiling as if nothing had happened !"
10373,He could hardly believe it and blinked several times .
10374,"' Well , don't I get a drink tonight ? ' she asked boldly ."
10375,"' Of course ... anything you like ' , he murmured ,"
10376,relief flooding over him . ' Kitty ... I 'm sorry ... . '
10377,His throat went tight and words failed him .
10378,"' Aw , forget it ' , she said cheerfully . ' I 'll sting"
10379,you for a double for being a naughty boy .
10380,How about the telly tomorrow afternoon ? '
10381,He felt a glow of happiness steal over him .
10382,"Everything was all right now , thank God . She"
10383,"wasn't going to break with him , after all ."
10384,For the moment it was the only thing in the
10385,world that mattered .
10386,"' Of course , Kitty ' , he said fervently , his eyes misty"
10387,"behind their thick lenses . ' Well , I 'll be off now . See you"
10388,"tomorrow ... and thank you ... . ' ' So long , Bob ' , she said ,"
10389,waving her hand to him . Harry followed him to the
10390,"door , opened it for him and stood outside on the step ,"
10391,"looking up at the sky , where a few pale stars shone"
10392,between puffs of light cumulus cloud .
10393,"' Nice night ' , he remarked affably . ' But they forecast rain"
10394,"for tomorrow . ' ' Do they ? ' Bone glanced up at the sky , his"
10395,"thoughts elsewhere . Personally , he didn't care if it rained cats"
10396,"and dogs and he knew that Harry didn't either . He waited ,"
10397,"pulling on his gloves and adjusting his hat . ' Look , Bob , '"
10398,"Harry began , after a brief silence , ' I don't mean to"
10399,"butt in , but if you take my advice you 'll 'ave no"
10400,more truck with 'er . '
10401,He jerked his thumb over his
10402,shoulder . ' That girl 's nothing but a load
10403,"of trouble , I 'm warning you . ' ' Kitty 's"
10404,"all right ' , Bone contradicted flatly . ' It 's"
10405,her boy-friend that 's the trouble . If
10406,we could get rid of him ... ' Harry
10407,nodded his grizzled head like an old
10408,"hound . ' You 're right there , Bob ' , he"
10409,muttered . ' But it 's easier said than done .
10410,"Kitty encourages him , too . No work , no"
10411,"background , no regular money so far as I"
10412,can make out . Probably on the crook .
10413,"But there you are , the girl 's wild and"
10414,headstrong . I can't do nothing with 'er . '
10415,"' Don't worry , Harry ' , the other said quietly ."
10416,' I won't make a fool of myself .
10417,Kitty needs a good friend and I 'll
10418,always be that . '
10419,"He paused , hatred of Stevie Hewitt"
10420,rising like gall in his throat .
10421,' And I 'll find a way of getting rid of
10422,"that chap , Hewitt , too . Leave it to me . '"
10423,"' O.K. , Bob , but watch your step . He 's"
10424,"a tough customer , mark my words ' , Harry"
10425,said in a low voice . Bone half smiled
10426,"in the darkness . ' I 'll remember ' , he said ."
10427,"' Good night , Harry . ' ' Good night , Bob . '"
10428,"Bone walked down the road , his cre*?"
10429,5pe-soled shoes making no sound
10430,on the asphalt surface . As he walked
10431,he concentrated on the problem of
10432,Stevie Hewitt . By comparison with the
10433,manner in which he had dispatched
10434,Henry Mansell the elimination of a
10435,little spiv from Brighton seemed an
10436,easy undertaking ... once he 'd set
10437,his mind to it .
10438,Back at the cottage he prepared his supper and ate
10439,"it beside the fire in the living-room , his thoughts once"
10440,more on Kitty . If she was really in love with Stevie
10441,"Hewitt it was madness to go on worrying about her , he"
10442,told himself moodily . Yet it was not as clear-cut as that .
10443,He not only felt his need of her but was equally aware
10444,"of the necessity to help and protect her , even against"
10445,her will .
10446,"Tonight , for the first time , he had abandoned all"
10447,pretence and shown her the honest desperation of his feeling
10448,for her . She had neither encouraged nor completely rejected
10449,him . In some perverse way their brief quarrel had forged
10450,a bond between them . No doubt she had every intention
10451,of keeping both of them on a string . On the whole he probably
10452,"had a slight advantage over the young man , inasmuch as he"
10453,had money to spend and she was a girl who had a healthy
10454,respect for the material things of life .
10455,Sentence Database L04-082
10456,But he was still no sort of match for a young
10457,and virile competitor and he knew it . He turned
10458,"away and begun to undress , shivering with the"
10459,cold . His eye automatically glanced towards the
10460,panel which concealed the hiding-place of his
10461,secret treasure . For an instant he stood
10462,"transfixed to the floor , his eyes unwavering"
10463,as they riveted themselves on the wall .
10464,Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided ?
10465,Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong
10466,panel and pulled it out . The black tin box was exactly
10467,as he had left it . With heavily beating heart he reached
10468,out and lifted the lid . Everything was intact and he
10469,gasped with relief .
10470,He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor
10471,"to count them . Of course , he remembered being in a great hurry to get"
10472,that fifty pounds for Kitty ! Obviously he had been careless in
10473,"replacing the panel , but the possibility of anyone having"
10474,discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock .
10475,"As he replaced the bundles of notes , he withdrew the tin"
10476,box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the
10477,cupboard .
10478,It would be safer under lock and key
10479,for the time being than behind a piece
10480,of panelling which did not fit very sec-
10481,urely . Tomorrow he would buy a
10482,heavy padlock for the box and search
10483,"for a new hiding-place . He lay in bed ,"
10484,"cold and uneasy , unable to account"
10485,for an instinctive sense of danger .
10486,When he closed his eyes it was
10487,"Henry Mansell's face he saw , hovering"
10488,above his head like a hideous caricature . The
10489,"parrot nose and straight line of the mouth ,"
10490,the pitiless blue eyes that seemed to strip
10491,him right down to his abjectly quaking
10492,bones . The mouldering horror that had
10493,once been Henry Mansell taunted him
10494,now in the silent darkness .
10495,In a corner of the saloon bar of the Six Bells at
10496,Hawkeshurst that Friday night Hugh Mansell and Roddy
10497,Dowell drank their beer and waited . ' It 's too damn busy
10498,"in here . We can't expect him to leave his customers ' ,"
10499,"Hugh said morosely . ' Give him a chance , old chap ."
10500,He 'll be over . Jim 's a most reliable chap when
10501,it comes to picking up a small tip . '
10502,"' O.K. , Roddy , whatever you say . ' Hugh drained his glass and"
10503,ordered two more beers . ' I 'm really beginning to feel it 's
10504,"all a bit of a waste of time , anyway . I 've been collecting"
10505,scraps of evidence and piecing them together for four
10506,"months now , and the whole lot still doesn't amount to"
10507,anything one could call concrete . '
10508,"Roddy puffed at his pipe , his eyes fixed on the white-coated"
10509,"barman . ' Oh , I think it does , Hugh . That 's"
10510,why I want you to meet this bird . I think
10511,he fills in an important part of the
10512,"background . Furthermore , dear boy , it confirms"
10513,what we already know of your father's
10514,intention to leave the country on the night
10515,of October 14th . '
10516,Hugh nodded . His face wore the melancholy expression
10517,that was habitual to him but his eyes showed
10518,"his inner excitement . ' I know , but from the"
10519,moment he walked out of here we haven't a
10520,shred of evidence to prove what happened .
10521,"Obviously he met someone , either by chance or"
10522,"by arrangement . Whichever way it was , that"
10523,person had a gun and he managed to persuade
10524,Father to drive along that quiet stretch of
10525,road ... . '
10526,' Miles off his proper route to Dover or the airport at
10527,"Lydd ' , Roddy interposed quickly . ' And once there he was"
10528,shot at close range and his money smartly filched .
10529,"You know , whoever it was might have known of the"
10530,existence of the suicide letter ... providing him with
10531,an almost unshakable alibi . ' Hugh was thinking of
10532,"his uncle , but said nothing . After all , Julian had"
10533,"acted very strangely since the tragedy , always"
10534,"secretive , always reluctant to discuss his brother's"
10535,death .
10536,It was impossible to associate him in one's mind with a
10537,"cold-blooded murder but , in fact , Henry Mansell's"
10538,death had saved the firm and Julian's future .
10539,Moreover he might well have been aware of his
10540,brother's intention to skip out of the country and
10541,"passed on the information . ' I 'm sure you 're right ' ,"
10542,Hugh said thoughtfully . ' But whoever did it got
10543,clean away without being spotted . '
10544,"' Easy enough along that stretch of coast road in winter ,"
10545,"believe me ' , Roddy affirmed solemnly . ' He probably caught"
10546,the next boat across the channel and has been lying low
10547,with the money somewhere . ' Hugh nodded . ' I realized that
10548,after my talk with Mrs. Lawford . There are a dozen countries
10549,where a man could easily hide up and change the money
10550,without danger .
10551,Unless we can get a definite line on him it 's
10552,"hopeless ... . ' ' Something will turn up one day , you 'll see ' ,"
10553,Roddy said confidently . ' If we plug away at the leads
10554,we have ... . ' ' If only the police would do something ... ' Hugh
10555,cried out in exasperation . ' I 've put everything I know
10556,before them ... . '
10557,"' No dice , Hugh . ' Roddy shook his sandy head ."
10558,' They 're bound to want pretty solid new evidence
10559,before they 'll agree to reopen the case . From
10560,their point of view the evidence for suicide is
10561,overwhelming . I spoke to a chap from the office of
10562,the Director of Public Prosecutions I know pretty
10563,"well , and he agreed that the missing cash is"
10564,a hell of a mystery .
10565,But as he quite reasonably pointed out the
10566,money could have been disposed of in London
10567,before your father left that evening . It wouldn't be
10568,unnatural for a man in his position to make provision
10569,for an unknown dependent or settle what he regarded
10570,as particular debts of honour before taking his own
10571,"life . Also , logically , there 's nothing to show the"
10572,money couldn't have been pinched by someone
10573,passing the car after your father was dead .
10574,Stealing from cars is about the commonest
10575,kind of crime in the book . There 's nothing
10576,that absolutely ties the missing money to the
10577,"circumstances of your father 's death , that 's"
10578,the point . Same with the passport . It 's gone
10579,and that 's that . It may turn up in a dustbin
10580,somewhere or at the back of a drawer . As
10581,far as the police are concerned there 's nothing
10582,to go on .
10583,In our own minds we may be pretty sure what
10584,"happened , but that 's not good enough for them ."
10585,That suicide letter did the trick - definite proof
10586,"that your father took his life , backed by"
10587,medical evidence and the fingerprint chaps . '
10588,A little man with thin brown hair and a
10589,ruddy complexion came over and greeted
10590,them .
10591,He wore a short white coat . Hugh ordered drinks .
10592,' I was sorry to read about your dad in the
10593,"paper ' , the man said to Hugh in a thick"
10594,voice which bore traces of a cockney accent .
10595,' I was telling your friend how he come
10596,in here the very night he passed away . '
10597,Hugh wasn't impressed with this ingratiating bar-
10598,man whom Roddy had raked up . He was seedy and
10599,middle-aged with small black eyes set close to-

10615,"If you 're right , you may be in serious danger from Hardy ."
10616,Even if you 're wrong you 'll most certainly be in danger when
10617,"you start handling a boat . "" He picked up his glass and"
10618,"held it in both hands , looking at me thoughtfully over the"
10619,"top of it . "" No , "" he said at last . "" I can't allow # #"
10620,"it . """
10621,""" You can't very well stop me . "" "" I can"
10622,do better than that . If we were to

10625,"plate , not daring to let him see"
10626,how much the idea appealed to
10627,"me , reminding myself that he could"
10628,only have said such a thing
10629,because he did not know the
10630,whole truth .
10631,""" And I can't allow that , "" I said ."
10632,""" Deadlock , "" said Max . "" No , it isn't ."
10633,"I 'm determined to go , and by myself ,"
10634,"whatever you say . "" "" I was afraid of"
10635,"that . "" He sounded resigned but none"
10636,"the less hopeful . "" You 're a very"

10638,your mind for you one of these
10639,days .

10641,"he told me . "" The sooner the better ."
10642,If you can get to Bletcham this
10643,evening I 'll run you up there
10644,"in the car . "" "" That 's very nice of"
10645,"you . "" "" Nice , nothing . I told you ,"
10646,I 'm mad about boats . Seven
10647,thirty do you ?
10648,"I could meet you at the bus station . """
10649,""" No , "" I said , "" outside your office . """
10650,I could not endure the thought
10651,of another wait at the bus station .
10652,He was there punctually . Dressed
10653,in a loud tartan shirt and abbreviated
10654,shorts he looked hardly more than
10655,"a boy , a cheerful , good-natured"
10656,boy . He settled me into the car
10657,with touching care and then
10658,drove like a fiend along
10659,the river road .
10660,Ten minutes later he stopped in a lane
10661,and helped me out with the same
10662,"careful courtesy . "" What sort of boat is it ? """
10663,"I asked . "" She , "" he corrected . "" She 's a"
10664,"converted life-boat . Not a very good one ,"
10665,but she 's sound enough and the
10666,"engine 's fine . """
10667,"Inside , she was untidy and grubby but"
10668,roomy enough and well lit by two rows of
10669,good-sized windows . It was a long time
10670,before I got used to calling them
10671,portholes . The owner was a middle-aged
10672,man whose family had tired of the
10673,limited excitement of the river and now
10674,had their eyes on a seagoing boat .
10675,Clive - he insisted on being called Clive -
10676,haggled with him and within half an hour
10677,Sandpiper was mine for three hundred and
10678,fifty pounds . When all the business details
10679,had been settled and the owner had
10680,"departed with my cheque in his pocket ,"
10681,Clive started the engine and gave me my
10682,first lesson in manoeuvring up and down
10683,the river and in and out of the other boats .
10684,"It was a warm , still evening ; the plop of"
10685,fish and the gentle putter of the engine
10686,"were infinitely soothing after city noises ,"
10687,and I began to look forward to my life
10688,on the water . At last he pronounced
10689,me riverworthy and wanted to know when
10690,I would be moving in .
10691,"Like Clive , he was enthusiastic about the"
10692,"engine and decided , apparently on the strength"
10693,"of its efficiency , that Sandpiper was fit to"
10694,live in . I was more than thankful for his help
10695,when we had installed my things and the
10696,boat began to move . The river was crowded
10697,with flocks of sailing boats which
10698,swirled round us like gulls and there
10699,"were two locks to negotiate , but Max"
10700,seemed to know exactly what to do
10701,and at the same time kept me supplied
10702,""" How on earth do you know all this ? "" I asked"
10703,"him . "" I used to play about in these things"
10704,when I was a kid . And then I acted as guide
10705,"on a river boat one summer , to keep myself"
10706,"going between terms at college . "" It was"
10707,"the first I had heard of it , but that 's"
10708,one of the things I like about Max .
10709,He has done so many things that there
10710,is always something new and exciting to
10711,"discover about him . "" You 're wonderful , "" I"
10712,"said , meaning it . He pressed the tip of my"
10713,"nose with one finger . "" That makes two of us . """
10714,It was about eight o'clock in the evening
10715,when we tied up almost exactly opposite
10716,Hardy's garden and went up on to the
10717,roof of the cabin to see what we could see .
10718,"From this side , Rivermead was less forbidding ;"
10719,it stood a long way back from the water
10720,at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with
10721,flowering trees and shrubs . To the right of
10722,"the lawn , close to the water's edge , stood an"
10723,ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria ; it
10724,was built across a narrow backwater
10725,and there was a delicate iron staircase
10726,climbing the outer wall to a room above .
10727,""" You won't see anyone tonight , it 's too late , "" Max"
10728,"said and turned to go . "" No - wait , "" I put out a"
10729,hand to stop him . The sun was no longer shining
10730,"and it was dark across there by the trees ,"
10731,but I thought I had seen something move .
10732,"A shudder , more mental than physical , ran"
10733,"through him , and his mind seemed to"
10734,melt away into emptiness . His bulging
10735,"eyes caught the reclining form of Heather ,"
10736,who was still repeating in sing-song :
10737,""" ... I will not give in ... "" He stared at her"
10738,"blankly , mouthing an incoherent gabble"
10739,of half words .
10740,He slapped himself in the face and
10741,cuffed the sides of his head . Then
10742,by degrees the rotating objects
10743,"slowed , and coming into focus took"
10744,the form of the furnishings in Dan
10745,Brown's living room . He stood up un-
10746,"steadily and looked about the room ,"
10747,trying to gather his wits . Outside the
10748,dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and
10749,the heights beyond were in
10750,"silhouette , already a solid black ."
10751,He bumped into a floor lamp and
10752,switched it on . Heather McNabb still lay
10753,"on the couch , her body uncomfortably twisted"
10754,and afflicted with occasional spasmodic jerks .
10755,He went to the kitchen for water and found
10756,Dan . Dan was lying on a long bench in the
10757,"breakfast nook , his head bent upright"
10758,against the wall .
10759,"His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat ,"
10760,as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks
10761,"brought forward . He mouthed a low mutter , punctuated at intervals"
10762,with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon . As
10763,"Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped shut ,"
10764,with jaws askew .
10765,There was utter imbecility in his blank face . Presently the
10766,"muttering started again , and went on and on . Stunned and"
10767,"shaken , Steve drew a glass of water and went back to"
10768,Heather . Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still
10769,trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects .
10770,For several minutes they had been facing each other across
10771,"a low table , like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with"
10772,each other through forced association .
10773,Then something like a zest for living began to come back
10774,to Steve and he squeezed her hand . Her face took on
10775,enough animation to produce a wan smile . Dan's low mut-
10776,tering was just audible from the kitchen . And Steve
10777,could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions
10778,she was growing cold and numb with shock . She had seen
10779,"Dan , or rather the physical relic of him - the empty"
10780,"shell of flesh and bone , devoid of intellect and"
10781,personality .
10782,"And these had been his great qualities ,"
10783,so attractive to her . The Base Station had
10784,"gone before , discharging its narrow plane of"
10785,4ementalating energy along the length of
10786,"the Earth's imaginary longitudes , moving"
10787,eastward like a knife-edged twilight in
10788,reversed progression . It had brought the
10789,"First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest ,"
10790,the empty-minded receptiveness that
10791,prepared the way for the Second Stage .
10792,He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
10793,"and came into the livingroom , where"
10794,Heather and Steve stood aghast at
10795,"his entrance . He came , almost falling"
10796,"forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck"
10797,"thrust out , arms dangling loosely ."
10798,"Then , abruptly , he drew himself up"
10799,and walked on the very tips of
10800,his toes . He stretched his arms
10801,"over his head and yawned agape ,"
10802,drawing-in great breaths that
10803,became great sighs of ecstacy .
10804,""" They have come ! "" he said reverently , gripping his"
10805,hands together between his knees and leaning
10806,"forward . "" Isn't it a glorious thing ! Long awaited"
10807,"transcendent event , the exalted desire of all"
10808,mankind through all ages ! The Kingdom of the
10809,"Mind is at hand ! "" He turned beaming eyes"
10810,upward and shook his head slowly from
10811,side to side .
10812,A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
10813,abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
10814,at an intersection for the light to change . At his
10815,apartment he garaged his car and then stood
10816,listening in the night . Listening in vain . For the
10817,"earth had lost its life-tempo , as the heart"
10818,loses its beat in death .
10819,"Deadly stillness , deadly portent !"
10820,Steve awakened early and switched on
10821,"the radio , which he kept tuned to CBO."
10822,The set lighted-up but gave only a low
10823,buzzing sound . He had just finished
10824,"shaving when it came on , with a flat"
10825,"voice repeating : "" This is BBC calling"
10826,"... this is BBC calling ... """
10827,"After what seemed an undue period of repetition , the voice"
10828,went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony
10829,"in Sussex , in all its obscene details . Then the radio"
10830,"went dead again , and Steve had no stomach for"
10831,"breakfast . It was a beautiful day , as firsts-of-June"
10832,should be . Steve got out the car and traversed the
10833,"same empty streets as he had the night before ,"
10834,to keep an appointment with Heather .
10835,Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
10836,"Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop . A"
10837,flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
10838,the War Memorial . There was a deep
10839,"whirring sound , and a high-pitched hissing"
10840,overtone that sang in his ears with an
10841,almost painful sharpness . He reversed and
10842,turned back on McKenzie Avenue .
10843,The Thetans must not see him ! He took another route
10844,to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on
10845,the way . Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at
10846,once ; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss
10847,"their situation , as far as it could be assessed ,"
10848,and to decide on what seemed to be the best
10849,way of meeting it .
10850,""" The Thetans , "" he said , "" are presumably here to"
10851,"take charge , as it were , of the minds of the"
10852,people - who are probably falling all over them-
10853,selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
10854,"them out . Just what these orders will be , we don't"
10855,"know . Now , because of prior hypnosis we have es-"
10856,caped Thetan subjugation . This time . But we no
10857,longer have any immunity .
10858,There can be little doubt that if the
10859,Thetans discover our mental independence
10860,they will promptly give us their hypnotic
10861,treatment . If we can avoid undue
10862,"prominence , it may be that we can"
10863,move about pretty freely without
10864,"detection . If we can - well , then we"
10865,may be able to promote our own
10866,interests . What those interests
10867,"are , beyond personal security ,"
10868,"I haven't a clue ; but , who knows ,"
10869,we may form the nucleus around ...
10870,""" Now , to summarize what I think our"
10871,"course of action should be . First , to avoid the"
10872,"Thetans like the plague , for they must not"
10873,"find us out ! Second , to tread pretty warily"
10874,"among our own people , finding out just how"
10875,much freedom we can take with safety .
10876,"And third , to study these damned Thetans ."
10877,We must learn all we can about
10878,them .
10879,There is just a hope that we may uncover
10880,"some weakness , and find a way of fighting"
10881,"back at them . "" Heather agreed , and suggested"
10882,that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
10883,ting how the Thetan machinations had been
10884,working out . It occurred to Steve that this may
10885,not have been entirely an objective suggestion
10886,on her part ; but he thought it a good idea
10887,nevertheless .
10888,So they proceeded to see if the coast
10889,was clear . The street was quiet and
10890,"deserted , and there were neither sight"
10891,nor sound of flying saucers . So they
10892,ventured forth and made their way on
10893,foot to Dan's house . Dan came
10894,to the door at their ring but neglected
10895,to offer any greeting . He was deeply
10896,"preoccupied , and it seemed that the"
10897,ringing of a doorbell was to him
10898,a new and strange phenomenon .
10899,"When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action"
10900,gave the impression of having been thought out and
10901,"decided upon . Inside they sat down unbidden , while"
10902,Dan paced the floor . He seemed completely unaware
10903,"of their presence . They just stared at him , turning"
10904,their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
10905,"down , up and down ."
10906,His whole attitude was a mixture of
10907,impatience pending an awaited
10908,communication and of a vague
10909,perplexity respecting his surroundings
10910,and the purpose he was to serve .
10911,"Finally , being so obviously on their own ,"
10912,Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
10913,at home . Steve switched on Dan's
10914,"powerful , world-wide radio and systematically"
10915,turned the tuning knob through all the
10916,tuning points of the world's great radio
10917,"They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue , where"
10918,he waited . The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street .
10919,"But not for long , for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon"
10920,the Avenue from its many tributary streets . It might have
10921,"been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies ."
10922,"First , it was Sunday morning ; and , second , everyone"
10923,"walked , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of"
10924,a single all-exclusive purpose .
10925,After a long wait a bus appeared and they
10926,"followed the beaming Dan aboard , taking"
10927,seats some rows behind him . Steve was
10928,"beginning to find the stereotyped , flattish , happy"
10929,faces very disconcerting ; and looking at
10930,Heather he found a welcome relief in her
10931,relatively long doleful one
10932,Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
10933,real days and would return to New York in late
10934,January or early February . Angelina might be a
10935,little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
10936,"as arranged , but he consoled himself by"
10937,thinking that he and Angelina would have
10938,plenty of time together in the future . And
10939,"Heaven alone knew when , if ever , he would be"
10940,"back on Moon again , and able to do"
10941,research at first hand into matters on which
10942,"the future of everyone , including Angelina , depended ..."
10943,The recovery of his balance was due to the
10944,"fact that he was living , virtually without"
10945,"expenses , with the people to whom Moke had"
10946,sent him : little people who regarded him as
10947,lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes .
10948,Tom Dreyfus had a job on the machines in the Secretariat
10949,( Stamp Department ) while Sally sulked at home .
10950,"They had been married for six years , but the"
10951,"salary raise , on the expectation of which they"
10952,"had done so , had not materialised . "" Do you"
10953,"know , I had to send back our bedroom"
10954,"furniture in the second year , "" she moaned . She"
10955,"had contacts in political circles , a school-"

10964,"evening , when he had been left to cook his own meal ."
10965,"All Sally's relations were 4makrodeb now , but Tom"

10971,penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general
10972,"interest to the Mos , doubtless because their habitat is"
10973,not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere .
10974,One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might
10975,"with time instil the reverence which , on Earth , nature inspires ,"
10976,especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's
10977,Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the

10979,"used in the last few wars , but it seemed very probable"
10980,"that they would be in the next one , Moon and her"
10981,allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the
10982,weapons pronounced conventional .

11034,did what they had to do to get GO on an expan-
11035,"ding scale , and left the sum-total of their actions ,"
11036,"and their lunar and earthly repercussions , to luck"
11037,"( or to Moke ) , there was a vacuum where there should"
11038,"be a centre of trust , responsible for the maintenance"
11039,The political life of Aristotle looked more and more
11040,like a masquerade of business interests in dis-
11041,"guise which , far from attracting the allegiance"
11042,"of free men everywhere , could only repel them ."
11043,Then what of the cultural life ? Did this per-
11044,haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse
11045,which might in time become social fact
11046,and counteract the obsession with economics
11047,which had grown up during the Moon's
11048,first two centuries ?
11049,At the centre of each circle stood personnel
11050,"managers of corporations , together with professors"
11051,and their filing clerks . The students had
11052,bought their college education forward and
11053,were now being bought forward in their
11054,turn . By comparing personal appearances
11055,"with university records , the agents of the"
11056,businesses would pick on young men
11057,"and women who interested them , and contracts"
11058,would be initialled at the end of
11059,the parade .
11060,But since starting salaries would depend on grade A
11061,"or B in the finals next May , and since mating"
11062,"prospects would depend upon salaries , scholarship for"
11063,these fine young people was closely geared to
11064,"economic and biological ends which , essentially ,"
11065,"were really means . So , seeing them revolve in"
11066,"circles , Harry had the feeling that Moke ( or what"
11067,"Moke consciously or unconsciously symbolised , any-"
11068,way in Harry's mind ) had these splendid young
11069,"people by the short hairs , and was diverting them ..."
11070,"Stepping out in their white shorts , they looked glad enough"
11071,"to be diverted , however , with the single exception of one"
11072,worried little man-student who kept getting out of
11073,step . He looked as if nothing Moke and his
11074,minions could do to him would ever make him
11075,GO ; but the reason probably lay in elementary
11076,neurosis and not in some eruption from those
11077,deeper layers in the human psyche which are
11078,trans-economic .
11079,"So once again the metaphysics were depressing ,"
11080,and in absolute contrast to the physical display .
11081,"Mos have an un-American love of parades , and"
11082,"these young ones , on parade for jobs which they"
11083,"had to get to pay off their college bills , were naturally"
11084,putting their best foot forward .
11085,"' Something 's up , ' said Lord Undertone ,"
11086,carefully casual . ' The servants are all on
11087,edge ... did you notice ? And the mules
11088,didn't seem to want to get off the raft . '
11089,He peered as it were into the dark secrets
11090,of the jungle . ' Think there 's Indians
11091,about ? ' It was most certainly an eerie
11092,"night , exceptionally brilliant and strange ,"
11093,"for in the proximity of the mountains ,"
11094,"whose presence I could almost smell ,"
11095,"' Impressive , ' Lord Undertone said , gazing reverently"
11096,on the cosmic handiwork . ' All those stars . But I 'm
11097,"a bit earthbound tonight , Trout . I 've got a queer"
11098,"feeling , like I always get when something"
11099,sensational 's going to happen . There 's things lurking
11100,"if you ask me . Might be jaguar , might be ..."
11101,head-shrinkers .
11102,"Hope I die kind of composed , Trout . I mean you can't"
11103,"imagine the Christian martyrs twisting and shrieking ,"
11104,"no matter how bad it felt , the fire you know , or a"
11105,"lion munching , or arrows where it hurts most . Or"
11106,can you . Look over there . ' He pointed to the
11107,shadows beyond the river . ' Something moved . '
11108,"' Bottle-Foot , my lord . ' ' Bottle-Foot ? ' His lordship"
11109,may have thought I had become unbalanced
11110,through fear . ' A character Mr Gilberto mentioned
11111,"to other day , my lord . A being of whom"
11112,the forest Indians are said to be mortally
11113,"afraid , with a hoof shaped like the heel"
11114,of a bottle . If your lordship will excuse me
11115,a moment ... '
11116,"Small , repulsive creatures they were ,"
11117,"with black , matted hair and a striking"
11118,resemblance to the shrunk heads we had
11119,gazed at recently ; and I have no
11120,hesitation in saying that they would have
11121,made an end of us but for an intervention
11122,"so unexpected , so unusual , that only the"
11123,necessity of rounding my narrative
11124,compels me to mention it .
11125,I had a distinct impression that the
11126,hut had recently been cleaned and
11127,prepared for visitors . Mrs Caine said
11128,we were to go no further unless and
11129,"until we were sent for , confirming"
11130,another impression that became more
11131,"and more definite , namely , that"
11132,she was in touch with an invi-
11133,sible source of authority .
11134,"Sally and of course Mrs Septimus , for surely"
11135,Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
11136,myself ? But was it so ? I allowed myself
11137,"to entertain for an instant the idea , the"
11138,"strange , the unwelcome , the almost"
11139,"inconceivable idea , that Ariadne's arrival"
11140,would be inopportune ; and with the idea came
11141,"a somewhat vulgar impulse , which I refused ,"
11142,"to watch Mr Septimus more closely , Mrs"
11143,Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would ...
11144,But all three were to the casual
11145,observation I permitted myself unruffled ;
11146,Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
11147,"thoughtful , but that was his habit . Indeed"
11148,we were all invaded by a most tranquil
11149,"mood . Even the Indian servants relaxed , knowing ,"
11150,"so Mr Gilberto told us , that the wild and"
11151,savage tribes never approached this region : at
11152,"any rate they remained with us , perhaps"
11153,"for such protection as our presence , or Mrs"
11154,But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never
11155,far from our minds that at any moment we were
11156,to receive a summons . I could see that Mr Septimus
11157,"was impatient for it . This afternoon , then , we climbed"
11158,"a promontory , a mass of clean rock crowned with"
11159,"trees and bushes , that stood well out over the lake ."
11160,NO ONE has ever satisfactorily explained how a
11161,single-decker Welsh bus could have got
11162,itself into orbit . Shooting up over the pass a bit
11163,"too carefree , and becoming airborne ?"
11164,Caught by a sudden gust of wind ? A
11165,combination of the two ? No one seems
11166,to know . But the fact remains that get
11167,itself into orbit it did .
11168,"And a fine old fuss there was about it , too ."
11169,"Here are the known facts . On 10th July ,"
11170,"the bus , the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl ,"
11171,left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual .
11172,"Aboard , apart from the crew , were Mrs. Megan"
11173,Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader ;
11174,pretty little Morfydd Owen ; Mr. Stanley Hayball
11175,"and Miss Ethel Yates , hikers from"
11176,Birmingham ; Price the Provisions ; and the
11177,Rev. Edwards .
11178,"Yes , the bus set out from Dinas . So much"
11179,"is established . Ifor Huw Evans , Propr. ,"
11180,watched it go from the windows of the
11181,"Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. Very interested ,"
11182,"Ifor was . For there was his garage hand ,"
11183,"Dai Pugh , taking a tearful farewell of"
11184,"Morfydd Owen . Morfydd , who had until"
11185,"recently been Ifor's typist , but was now"
11186,returning to her home town as a
11187,fully-fledged schoolteacher .
11188,""" But I 'm only going fifteen miles away , """
11189,"Morfydd was saying . "" Not the end of"
11190,"the world , is it ? "" "" For me it is , "" Dai"
11191,"said wretchedly , wiping his hands on his"
11192,"overalls preparatory to a last embrace . "" You"
11193,will not be remembering a mere garage
11194,hand when you are lording it over
11195,"the Mixed Infants of Llangrwl . """
11196,""" Silly boy , "" said Morfydd . Though she"
11197,"could not help wondering whether , now she"
11198,"had qualified as a schoolteacher , poor"
11199,little Dai was quite the man for her .
11200,A nice boy of course . But perhaps in the
11201,new world she was entering there might
11202,"be boys equally nice , and with far more"
11203,to offer . The conductor rang his bell .
11204,""" Good-bye , Dai , "" said Morfydd , smiling from the bottom step ."
11205,""" Good-bye , Morfydd . "" He sought to enfold her in his arms . But he was too late ."
11206,"She was already up the bus steps , and the bus was away . And Morfydd Owen"
11207,"waving , unkissed , from the window . And Dai , on the pavement , knowing in his"
11208,heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas .
11209,"So the bus set out for Llangrwl . But it never reached there ! Somewhere ,"
11210,"on those fifteen miles of mountain roads , it disappeared from the earthly"
11211,scene . The first intimation that all was not well came when a
11212,"Mr. Isaiah Roberts , landlord of The Traveller's Joy , rang up the"
11213,Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their
11214,damn bus .
11215,""" Left here all right , "" said Ifor . "" Two-thirty-five , on the dot . "" "" It 's"
11216,"supposed to leave at two-twenty . "" "" Who says so ? "" "" Your timetable . """
11217,""" Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables , "" Ifor said ,"
11218,"reasonably . "" Start running punctual and where are you ? People get"
11219,"left behind , isn't it ? Very exasperating for one and all . """
11220,""" And what are you going to do about it ? "" Tendentious , Mr. Roberts sounded ."
11221,""" What do you want me to do ? Send out a sheriff's posse , is it ? "" No sense"
11222,"of humour , that Isaiah . He banged down the receiver . Very uncivil . Dropped"
11223,"the mask , now , Ifor did . "" Dai Pugh , "" he bellowed . "" Leap on your bicycle"
11224,and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy .
11225,The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to
11226,"complete her mission . "" Paled , did Dai . For the"
11227,"two-twenty carried , for him , a cargo more"
11228,precious than jewels . Though Mofydd Owen
11229,"was , as he feared , departed out of his life ,"
11230,"he still loved her dearly . Already , even"
11231,as with trembling fingers he fastened his
11232,"trouser clips , he was seeing her lying in"
11233,"some dreadful ravine , or beset by"
11234,"robbers , or being whisked off to Emergency"
11235,Ward 10 .
11236,"But even his imagination , luckily for him ,"
11237,did not visualise the awful truth - that
11238,Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for
11239,"the title of "" First Woman to Enter Space . """
11240,""" Where are we going , Mam ? "" inquired little"
11241,Cadwallader when his child mind grasped
11242,the fact that the green earth was falling
11243,away at a rate of knots .
11244,Where indeed ? Megan Thomas spoke sharply
11245,"to the conductor , demanding an explanation ."
11246,"But nonplussed , the conductor was . A"
11247,"good man , mind ; knew his job . But out of"
11248,depth in this particular instance . Fingered
11249,his ticket-punch nervously . Peered out of
11250,the window . Went and consulted the driver .
11251,""" Where are we going ? "" he echoed Cadwallader ."
11252,""" Damned if I know , boy , "" said the driver ."
11253,""" But something very untoward has"
11254,"happened , if you ask me . """
11255,"Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser , was the"
11256,"Rev. Edwards . Now he put down his paper ,"
11257,"folded it , and glanced idly out of the"
11258,"window . Looked again , eyes starting from"
11259,"his head . "" God bless my immortal soul , """

11275,Morfydd Owen was silent . But she
11276,looked down at the fast-disappearing

11278,would never see her Dai again . And
11279,though half an hour ago she had
11280,regarded this possibility with
11281,"fortitude , it now filled her with"
11282,dismay . Quietly she began to
11283,weep ...
11284,"Dai , meanwhile , was pedalling"
11285,furiously on the road . Not a sign of

11288,walking very dogged towards Llangrwl .

11290,as he shot past . His spirits were rising .
11291,He had seen no sign of an accident .

11293,He would find the bus safe and sound in
11294,"Llangrwl , and his dear Morfydd quietly"

11304,"few lone stars , and the distant earth"
11305,brooding in her shroud of mist .

11448,heedlessly thrown down their souls .
11449,Haris had trampled on his . It was unthinkable !
11450,' You see . You needed them no more . You are still
11451,young . You may be able to have babies . Some of those
11452,babies may be born with wings . ' The Captive with
11453,"the boneless arms added , ' Some may be born wrong ,"
11454,as we are . Some may be born right . '
11455,' You are too foul to live ! ' Haris growled . ' Why are
11456,"you not killed ? ' ' Because we know all things , ' the"
11457,Chief Captive said . Suddenly his second head roused
11458,"itself and declared , ' To be a good shape is not all"
11459,in life . To know is also good . Because we cannot move
11460,well we can - think . This tribe of the True World
11461,is good and knows these things .
11462,So it lets us rule it . ' Flor and Lily-yo
11463,muttered together . ' Do you say that you poor
11464,Captives rule the True World ? ' Lily-yo asked
11465,at last . ' We do . ' ' Then why are you captives ? '
11466,"The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected ,"
11467,"making his perpetual little gesture of protest ,"
11468,spoke for the first time .
11469,"' To rule is to serve , woman . Those who bear power"
11470,are slaves to it . Only an outcast is free . Because
11471,"we are Captives , we have the time to talk and"
11472,think and plan and know . Those who know
11473,command the knives of others . ' ' No hurt will
11474,"come to you , Lily-yo , ' Band Appa Bondi added ."
11475,' You will live among us and enjoy your life free
11476,from harm . '
11477,' No ! ' the Chief Captive said with both mouths .
11478,"' Before she can enjoy , Lily-yo and her companion"
11479,Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless -
11480,must help our great plan . ' ' The invasion ? ' Bondi
11481,"asked . ' What else ? Flor and Lily-yo , you arrive"
11482,here at a good time . Memories of the Heavy World
11483,and its savage life are still fresh in you .
11484,We need such memories . So we ask you to go
11485,back there on a great plan we have . ' ' Go back ? '
11486,gasped Flor . ' Yes . We plan to attack the Heavy
11487,World . You must help to lead our force . ' The long
11488,"afternoon of eternity wore on , that long golden road"
11489,of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
11490,everlasting night .
11491,"Motion there was , but motion without event - except"
11492,for those negligible events that seemed so large to
11493,"the creatures participating in them . For Lily-yo , Flor"
11494,and Haris there were many events . Chief of these was
11495,that they learned to fly properly . The pains associated
11496,with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
11497,new flesh and tendon strengthened . To sail up in the
11498,light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
11499,flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
11500,had no place here .
11501,Alastair was a bachelor . All his life he had
11502,been inclined to regard women as something
11503,which must necessarily be subordinated to his
11504,career . Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
11505,"his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl"
11506,whom he had never met and on whom after no more
11507,than a couple of telephone calls he was
11508,prepared to place complete reliance .
11509,It was a novel experience . Alastair was
11510,quite unable to explain why he should feel
11511,so much confidence in her . Once again
11512,she checked back her instructions . It was
11513,obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
11514,faith which he was placing in her and
11515,was prepared to accept the responsibility .
11516,""" Good luck , Air Marshal , "" she said gently . "" I 'll"
11517,be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
11518,evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
11519,"both at midnight . "" They might have been"
11520,arranging a supper party . Then she rang off .
11521,Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
11522,uneventful life had he come across a girl who
11523,sounded so charming and appeared to be so
11524,efficient .
11525,For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
11526,to switch on the lights ; there was no colour -
11527,physical features were distinguishable solely by
11528,gradations of silvery greyness . Even the snow-
11529,"capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles"
11530,"below , was not recognisable among the host"
11531,of lower peaks . The screen of the air-to-air
11532,radar glowed . Occasionally minute spots
11533,"flickered across its surface , but there was"
11534,no permanent image .
11535,In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
11536,make a direct comparison between the radar
11537,image and the ground itself . Ahead lay the
11538,"Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the"
11539,"left , Milan . The directional angle of the"
11540,scanner could be adjusted to cover any
11541,particular area within its range . Geoffrey
11542,turned the scale slowly to cover the
11543,ground immediately ahead .
11544,"He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the"
11545,"naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even"
11546,on the clearest night limited angular vision . He glanced
11547,at the speed recorder . It seemed almost incredible that
11548,the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
11549,was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .
11550,"Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the"
11551,pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
11552,dipped slightly . The needle of the speed
11553,"recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0"
11554,"before coming to rest at 5.0 . "" We 're a bit"
11555,"ahead of time , "" said Alastair . "" We 'll run"
11556,"in on minimum engine power . "" Geoffrey"
11557,smiled . Alastair talked of running in when
11558,they were still more than four hundred
11559,miles from their destination .
11560,They were nearing Modena . Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
11561,"on the bridge over the Po , barely forty miles to port ."
11562,He was able to trace the course of the river ; he
11563,"thought he could recognise the route of N12 ,"
11564,along which he had motored so desperately little
11565,more than twenty-four hours earlier . Since then
11566,"he had flown to England , attended the vital"
11567,"conference in Bruce Denton's office , been whisked"
11568,by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
11569,"Parade to Boscombe Down , slept for six blessed"
11570,refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
11571,of the journey back to the place where every
11572,indication pointed to Eve being held .
11573,Geoffrey set himself to consider the
11574,movements of the Bentley . It had passed
11575,him at the temporary bridge over the
11576,Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
11577,previous night . He worked out the distance
11578,on the presumption that its route had been
11579,through Florence and Rome and then
11580,across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
11581,It came to just over six hundred
11582,miles .
11583,DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the
11584,"time they docked at Belleray . And though Guy ,"
11585,"made nervous by Beryl's silence , drove at reckless"
11586,"speed to the Villa , it was quickly evident that"
11587,the party was over . Piers came strolling out to
11588,"meet the Deanes , and as soon as Guy had"
11589,"driven away , invited them casually to come to"
11590,his flat for a drink .
11591,"To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a"
11592,vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent
11593,reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
11594,But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
11595,was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
11596,"He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his"
11597,"own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of"
11598,asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
11599,to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
11600,""" I caught him just as he was going to the"
11601,"airport to meet Blanche , "" he said . "" As a matter"
11602,of fact I 'd asked him last night to deputise
11603,for me and fetch her . He brought her to the party
11604,"too . They 're both here . "" "" I didn't know she was"
11605,"coming back from Barbados so soon . "" Beryl"
11606,said the first thing that came into her head .
11607,""" Oh , she was due ! "" And then he added in the same"
11608,"casual tone , "" She 's not returning to her family . She 's"
11609,"going to live with friends of the bank manager , just"
11610,"this side of Belleray . "" Mrs. Deane made a suitable"
11611,"comment , but Beryl said nothing . She was trying"
11612,to sort things out in her mind . That beneath his
11613,unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering
11614,with anger against her she had no doubt .
11615,"Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to"
11616,express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
11617,"of his guests . But Piers remained aloof , and when Beryl"
11618,"suggested having a second party , the following week , he"
11619,"poured cold water on the project . Everyone , he declared ,"
11620,"had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them"
11621,nearly to next week to settle down again . Meanwhile
11622,Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
11623,earned gratuity to his native village at the
11624,north of the island .
11625,It was all over and done with .
11626,For the time being Beryl was content to let
11627,"it go at that , but she resolved to have"
11628,it out with Piers when a reasonable
11629,opportunity presented itself . He must
11630,learn that he could not treat her
11631,"with injustice and contempt , ignoring"
11632,her explanations as though he were
11633,"a schoolmaster and she a small ,"
11634,ignorant child .
11635,He gave her no chance of any private
11636,"conversation that evening , for when"
11637,"Blanche and Jack left , he went with"
11638,them . But next morning she insisted
11639,on his taking her out in the jeep -
11640,"to find , if possible , Hubert and his"
11641,"relations , and tell them of"
11642,her great disappointment at being
11643,held up in Balicou .
11644,"With an air of resignation he sent Judy , his"
11645,"Boxer , to the back , and made room for her"
11646,"beside him . "" Is that all you want to do ? """
11647,"he asked , letting in the clutch . "" No ; I want"
11648,to make you understand just what happened
11649,"about this Balicou trip , "" she returned"
11650,"coldly . "" I 'm a little tired of being treated"
11651,"like an ineffective imbecile . """
11652,""" And I 'm heartily sick of being constantly called"
11653,"to account for my manners , "" he retorted ."
11654,""" What have I done wrong now ? I cover up for"
11655,you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
11656,"to make the presentation , I run the damned"
11657,party to the best of my ability - saying the
11658,sugary things you ought to have been there
11659,to say - and all you can do is to find
11660,"fault . """
11661,""" It 's your superior attitude that riles me . "" Beryl was"
11662,"scarlet with annoyance . "" How I happened to be marooned"
11663,at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree . You
11664,"look as though it was only what you expected of me ,"
11665,as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert
11666,"and his pals down . """
11667,""" As your employee it 's not my business"
11668,to understand all the whys and
11669,"wherefores of your actions , "" he said"
11670,"stiffly . "" Still less to criticise you . """
11671,""" Oh , drop that nonsense , Piers !"
11672,"Be yourself , "" she exclaimed , with"
11673,"mounting exasperation . "" Very well ! "" He"
11674,brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
11675,path fringed and shaded by citrus trees .
11676,""" If you want my true opinion I 'll give it ."
11677,You made some sort of a protest to Graybury .
11678,I 'll give you credit for that . But you didn't press
11679,"the matter because , very naturally , you were"
11680,thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in
11681,"idyllic surroundings . "" "" How dare you say"
11682,"such a thing ? "" she blazed . "" For goodness'"
11683,"sake show a glimmer of reason , "" was his"
11684,equally indignant rejoinder .
11685,""" You talk as though we were alone on Balicou ! """
11686,"She avoided his gaze , and tried to ignore that"
11687,"last impertinent remark . "" With four other people - """
11688,""" Whom you never once managed to circumvent . """
11689,"The mockery in his voice had deepened . "" With"
11690,"all due deference , Miss Deane - come off it ! """
11691,She met his eyes then .
11692,"She wavered , and at last said"
11693,"slowly , "" If you must drag the truth"
11694,"out of me , I must ask you to regard"
11695,"it as confidential . "" "" My dear Beryl ,"
11696,"don't tell me anything , if you 'd rather"
11697,"not . "" He was clearly startled by her"
11698,"words . "" But remember , it was you ,"
11699,"not I , who started this conversation . """
11700,""" I know . Absurd as it may seem , I didn't want"
11701,"you to think badly of me . "" She turned away"
11702,"from him to fondle Judy , who , sensing something"
11703,"amiss , was nudging her in the endeavour to"
11704,"gain her attention . "" The truth is that"
11705,if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the
11706,"time originally arranged , Sir John would"
11707,have had it in for Guy .
11708,"You see , it was , apparently , through a mistake"
11709,on Guy's part that we missed seeing the
11710,"flamingoes our first morning on the island . """
11711,""" What harm could possibly have come to Forrest"
11712,"through Sir John's nonsense ? "" Piers could"
11713,hardly have spoken with more contempt .
11714,A bully like that respects anyone who
11715,"dares to stand up to him . """
11716,Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was
11717,precisely the remark she had made to Guy .
11718,"She said icily , "" As you pride yourself on"
11719,your knowledge of all the affairs of the
11720,island I needn't tell you that Sir John
11721,Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most
11722,"important customers . "" "" So what ? You 're not"
11723,trying to say that Hewson would victimise
11724,Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral
11725,courage !
11726,He 's quite capable of telling Sir John to take
11727,himself and his business to an unmention-
11728,"able destination . "" "" There 's a difference"
11729,between what a senior and a junior
11730,"partner can do , "" was her quick reply ."
11731,""" What they can bring off ! I 'll admit that ."
11732,But Forrest might at least have tried . He 's
11733,"pretty spineless ! """
11734,""" You think you could have carried more weight"
11735,"with Sir John ? "" she enquired cuttingly ."
11736,""" For all your good opinion of yourself ,"
11737,I doubt it . He 's about as easy to push around
11738,"as - as a grounded whale ! "" He had to smile"
11739,"at that , but went on airily , "" I 'd have made"
11740,an attempt to show my lady-love that I
11741,put her interests before my own .
11742,"She was tempted to laugh , but it was as though that barb still stuck"
11743,"in her quivering flesh . "" You 've an answer - of sorts - for everything , "" she"
11744,"said shortly . "" Personally I 've no more to say , so I suggest we get"
11745,"along . "" To her great relief they arrived at the cluster of little houses"
11746,where Hubert had been living to find the old man stowing in
11747,leisurely fashion his few possessions into a ramshackle and
11748,"incredibly ancient car , surrounded by innumerable friends and relatives ."
11749,Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
11750,to have been guests at yesterday's
11751,"celebrations , and their friendly welcome"
11752,"and warm sympathy , as she explained"
11753,"how she had come to miss the party ,"
11754,made her send a complacent glance
11755,in Piers' direction . What a fuss-box the
11756,"man was , she thought impatiently ,"
11757,trying to worry her into the belief
11758,that her failure to appear at a function
11759,on the estate was a major error :
11760,"And then she received a jolt . Old Hubert , standing"
11761,"beside her , his battered hat in his hand , his"
11762,"toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin , told her"
11763,"in halting 6patois that "" 3Mistah Piers "" had"
11764,"explained right at the start that "" 3Mis' Beryl """
11765,"would be 3"" plenty , plenty sad "" not to be back"
11766,at the Villa in time .
11767,That it wouldn't be her fault at all . That
11768,"she was a lady who , like her Uncle Charles ,"
11769,"took the highest pride in keeping her word . "" I"
11770,"could see 3anudder 3t'ing , "" he went on in a"
11771,"lower voice , his sunken black eyes twinkling ."
11772,"3"" He powerful anxious , poor Mistah Piers ."
11773,We all know how Balicou Island dangerous
11774,"to all kin' o' boats , wid d'ose big , big"
11775,rocks in an' out o' de water .
11776,He had almost entirely settled back into his old
11777,"ways , even to reading law about two hours each"
11778,"day . Though he did not refuse wine , which the"
11779,"judge always had on the table at dinner , he"
11780,did not act as though he found it necessary
11781,except in moderate compliance with his father's
11782,habit .
11783,Around that rounded rocky promontory where the
11784,white spray could be seen flying across the distance
11785,"of a mile and a half , came the yawl under her full"
11786,"triangular sail , and to the judge's frightened eyes , so"
11787,close to the rocks that it would be dashed
11788,against them with the lift of the next wave .
11789,""" That boy ! That damned fool boy ! What does he mean"
11790,"by trying to come home now , even if he did promise ?"
11791,What does time mean when weighed against the life of

11793,yawl had rounded the rocky point instead of
11794,being flung against the huge boulders did the judge
11795,empty his lungs of stifling air and refill them
11796,with part of that howling northwest gale .
11797,"When the wind was on a rampage , as it was"
11798,"now , it could kick up a sea-sized commotion"
11799,where it had a straight blow of eight miles
11800,"down the lake . 3"" Big blow , Judge , "" re-"

11816,"The yawl , riding the high waves with an air that"
11817,"might have made an ocean liner envious , seemed"
11818,prepared to make a safe though violent landing
11819,when there came a sudden gust of wind
11820,from the west .
11821,""" My God ! "" the judge cried out . "" The boy"
11822,is going to try to make a landing on the

11826,"quick shift of tiller , and at the same time"
11827,jibbing the boom to which he had the
11828,"stay rope fastened , Bill made the"
11829,yawl recover .
11830,It seemed to the frightened judge
11831,as though his son would actually
11832,shoot the craft in under the outer
11833,end of the wharf . But by pressing
11834,the tiller hard over and at the
11835,same time dropping the small sheet

11917,another home . In the ten years of married life
11918,this had already happened half a dozen times .
11919,Such is the life of a naval officer's wife .
11920,John's father had been a naval officer of the old
11921,school ; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
11922,on to the second generation . One of these was that
11923,"an officer should join a ship , on taking up a"
11924,"new appointment , at nine a.m. precisely , dressed"
11925,in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword .
11926,It would have been acceptable to all concerned
11927,if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in
11928,"plain-clothes on the previous night , but ways"
11929,instilled by martinet parents have a habit of
11930,sticking .
11931,"So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head , that"
11932,"famous Portsmouth hostelry , second only in historic"
11933,"interest to The George , unhappily destroyed by German"
11934,bombs during the last war . Having deposited his
11935,baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
11936,went in search of a drink . The lower bar was
11937,"empty , save for the lady known by all habitue"
11938,"*?2s as ' Seaweed ' , and a youngish , sharp-eyed"
11939,man who was staring moodily into a gin
11940,and tonic .
11941,Seaweed's memory was prodigious ; her manner
11942,must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
11943,"of the hotel . She greeted John , however , with less"
11944,than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
11945,glance at him . Evidently the other occupant
11946,of the bar was not 6persona grata . If her
11947,"memory was good , so was this stranger's ."

12085,""" I shall be busy for a while , cleaning up after"

12087,lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse .
12088,Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
12089,"sounded , for all of them were rumbling as they"
12090,charged their electric batteries .
12091,A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
12092,through the open windows of the Captain's house . It
12093,pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
12094,Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
12095,a substantial breakfast . Although usually a very
12096,talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
12097,"silences , for she knew they betokened a worry of"
12098,some sort .
12099,There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
12100,affair of Parsifal . Harry had lost a good deal of weight .
12101,"His normal placid and steady-going manner remained ,"
12102,but she could see that it no longer came naturally .
12103,It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
12104,"to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine ,"
12105,though in peace time these happenings are few and
12106,far between .
12107,This is the testing time for all . The affair blows up into
12108,a national disaster and then when it is all over life
12109,must continue as before . During this period the Captain
12110,must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
12111,if nothing unusual has happened . Harry Turton had
12112,"written letters to the bereaved , had visited many in the"
12113,"locality , had been interviewed by the Press , had driven"
12114,his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
12115,usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
12116,suitable for such occasions .
12117,He rode down to where I was waiting . I was
12118,thinking what a skill he had for reading
12119,"my mind . "" This would be as good a place"

12158,country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing .
12159,The air was fresh and clear and you
12160,could see far over west and north for many
12161,miles . The real high country of the Rockies
12162,lifted up in the distance like a pale water-
12163,colour drawing . Between us and that lay

12169,"So we swung west , making slow going over"
12170,"rough country , sliding on shale , climbing down"
12171,"into draws , circling a big mesa by a"
12172,"four or five mile valley , sandy-floored . It"
12173,got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
12174,gratefully by a small creek where we watered
12175,the horses and drank enough to cure our
12176,thirst .
12177,An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
12178,we figured would lead to the miners' camp .
12179,We turned north into it and after about four
12180,miles it led into a small canyon which
12181,opened out into a wide shallow draw .
12182,Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
12183,the miners at work . They were scattered
12184,over a fairly wide area working singly or
12185,in pairs .
12186,We didn't approach unchallenged . Just short
12187,of the diggings there was a roughly-built
12188,shack and as we got near someone inside bawled

12202,was never long on patience .

12204,the shack . They were all armed with rifles .
12205,As the nearest of them came round the
12206,"shack , his rifle at the ready , I saw it was Nick"
12207,"Dowd , still wearing his blue check shirt . He"
12208,"came up close , eyeing us suspiciously . "" We 've"

13118,lady who loved small talk and the discreet
13119,accumulation of money .
13120,"We went in . There were a few people in the bar ,"
13121,"elderly , well-off , artistic , who , you felt , had made a hard"
13122,"bargain for giving up . ' I have furnished rooms , ' said"
13123,"Pierre , ' and all mod cons . ' The price was 16,000 francs a"
13124,"month . ' Yes , ' we said immediately , even before viewing ."
13125,We were shown around by Pierre .
13126,The flat was on the third floor ; two rooms ; soft Provenc*?
13127,6al view ; good intimate furnishing and colour ; running
13128,"hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up ,"
13129,"basin and bidet ; own private , modern lavatory . The"
13130,first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence .
13131,We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft
13132,eruption of turtle-doves .
13133,"This was strange , even magic , because the owner's"
13134,"name was Pierre Tortorolo which , in Nicoison Italian means"
13135,' turtledove ' . Pierre Turtledove . When we woke up properly it
13136,"was raining , an even more hopeless rain than London , and we"
13137,looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the
13138,curling white breath of the mountains . The land looked
13139,like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her
13140,shame .
13141,"There they were , in fact , below us , eight of them ."
13142,"Four of them were flattened on the window sills , two"
13143,"immolated on a nearby roof top , the other pair copulating ."
13144,We had a morning at Pierre's . He talked about people .
13145,Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named
13146,"Lawrence . He was here , near the railway station , three or"
13147,"four years . During this period he wrote a book ,"
13148,The Lover of Lady Chatterly .
13149,"No , he hadn't read it ; Madame did all the"
13150,reading . Lawrence died in this very place .
13151,He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and
13152,"again . No , he couldn't really remember"
13153,"him , he was one of the crowd . The"
13154,sun came out ; Mart went shopping ; I
13155,sat in the square reading the Patriote .
13156,There was a front-page rear-attack on de
13157,"Gaulle , and the rest of the paper was given up"
13158,"to murders , apart for an outcry against a"
13159,proposal to drop radio-active material into
13160,the Mediterranean between Corsica and St
13161,Raphael . All the murders were well documented
13162,and had the air of being written by an
13163,"ingenious , but mad film director of the"
13164,Thirties .
13165,They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses .
13166,"Monsieur H , for instance , had been clubbed and"
13167,"throttled to death by his wife , children and"
13168,"father-in-law , after muddling up some sheep"
13169,while the worse for drink . The family
13170,group then sat down for a late lunch
13171,before the father-in-law telephoned the police .
13172,"Then again , Monsieur V , owing to family"
13173,"troubles , had written to the local"
13174,"paper and the superintendent of police ,"
13175,informing them that he was on the point
13176,Monsieur V's house was immediately
13177,"surrounded by firemen and other officials ,"
13178,but there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned
13179,"a few minutes later from a nearby village ,"
13180,"apologising for the trouble , but explaining"
13181,that the walls were porous and the
13182,gas had escaped . General relief was
13183,"expressed , but Monsieur V ( this was"
13184,actually reported in the next issue ) returned
13185,"home and shot himself , leaving a note"
13186,which again left his household goods
13187,Some grim comic relief was provided by
13188,an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot
13189,who hid himself in a bush and imitated
13190,a blackbird . Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver
13191,was after this very bird and shot the farm-
13192,"labourer in the face . All , however ,"
13193,"ended well , reported the paper , since the"
13194,pellets were easily removed and the
13195,labourer was able to return to work the
13196,same afternoon .
13197,We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta .
13198,You can free-wheel down a quarter of the
13199,way . In the middle of the journey is a
13200,valley with a sea of vines and olives
13201,and beaches of earth pricked to blood by
13202,the hoe . Rising from the flecked sea are
13203,islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and
13204,"towns , grey , rose-headed mariners clinging"
13205,like limpets to the rock .
13206,There is a curd of morning smoke and
13207,a muffled bell taps the sky . Here we
13208,"stopped , as in fine weather we always"
13209,stopped . Down below is the village of
13210,"Cagnes , but between are pockets of"
13211,heat and cold like the hands of
13212,"friends or strangers , and a flurry of"
13213,"early smells , the dark bosoms of"
13214,beech and the thin pine fingers
13215,kissed by the sun .
13216,"Then here was Nice , and the old holiday"
13217,"sea , blue as a new school exercise"
13218,"book . The same old Nice , creamy ,"
13219,"vulgar , out of time , bitter-sweet with"
13220,the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
13221,"prostitutes , edging past grubby grandeur"
13222,"to the old sleeping port . This , and"
13223,"Paris , were my ruined pavilions , and I"
13224,could catch the taste of dead dreams on
13225,my tongue like spray .
13226,We parked the Lambretta opposite the
13227,"Negresco , and went to the beach to"
13228,have a swim . Amazing bedlam rocked
13229,"in our eyes . The sea boiled with waves ,"
13230,they galloped to the walls and spumed
13231,over the Promenade des Anglais . A huge
13232,crowd had collected . There were firemen
13233,"and policemen and ambulances , and the"
13234,eyes of the spectators were hard with
13235,disaster .
13236,They all had that neat look of
13237,Mediterranean people to whom nothing
13238,"could ever happen , the chosen sane , the"
13239,"uncuckolded , unrobbed , sheltered from"
13240,"disease and accident by doctors , God and"
13241,"the municipality . Yet , at any time now ,"
13242,the bell would ring for them - the gilded
13243,"love house , the mad grandmother or the"
13244,bloody child at the crossroads .
13245,It was growing cold . We left the
13246,crowd and drove back to Vence .
13247,The cool evening perfumes stood
13248,beckoning at the corners of the roads .
13249,Mart is unable to smell ( her sense
13250,"organs were impaired years ago ) , and"
13251,"I had to explain the low , sharp and"
13252,sweet signals in the air . When we
13253,got back home we felt exhausted .
13254,"London sickness ( a sense of guilt ,"
13255,mingled with the memory of sandwiches
13256,We went straight to bed and slept until
13257,the turtle-doves drummed up the
13258,"sun . The next morning , in the square"
13259,"opposite Pierre's , I read about the Nice"
13260,beach catastrophe in the Patriote .
13261,"Mart had been right , the body had been"
13262,a woman's . It belonged to a Madame
13263,N. Enquiries had been made in the
13264,"neighbourhood , and it transpired that"
13265,Madame N's husband had made an
13266,arrangement with the dead lady's sister
13267,"The sister , able to swim , had returned"
13268,"to the shore , but instead of returning"
13269,to her brother-in-law ( with whom
13270,"she had an illicit relationship ) , she"
13271,went to her fiance*?2's house and
13272,confessed everything . Her fiance*?2
13273,"reported her to the police , and then jumped"
13274,off a cliff near Monte Carlo .
13275,The day I promised to take Catherine
13276,down to visit my young friend Philip
13277,"at his school in the country , we were"
13278,"to leave at eleven , but she arrived"
13279,"at nine . Her blue dress was new ,"
13280,and so were her fashionable shoes . Her
13281,hair had just been done . She looked
13282,more than ever like a pink and gold
13283,Renoir girl who expects everything from
13284,life .
13285,Catherine lives in a white house
13286,overlooking the sweeping brown tides
13287,of the river . She helped me clean up my
13288,flat with a devotion which said that
13289,she felt small flats were altogether more
13290,romantic than large houses . We drank
13291,"tea , and talked mainly about Philip , who ,"
13292,"being 15 , has pure stern tastes in every-"
13293,thing from food to music .
13294,Catherine looked at the books lying
13295,"around his room , and asked if she"
13296,might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
13297,to read on the train . Catherine is 13 .
13298,I suggested she might find them dif-
13299,"ficult , but she said , ' Philip reads them ,"
13300,doesn't he ? ' During the journey I read
13301,newspapers and watched her pretty
13302,frowning face as she turned the
13303,"pages of Babel , for she was determined"
13304,to let nothing get between her and
13305,"At the school , which is charming , ci-"
13306,"vilised and expensive , the two children"
13307,"walked together across green fields , and"
13308,"I followed , seeing how the sun gilded"
13309,their bright friendly heads turned
13310,towards each other as they talked . In
13311,Catherine's left hand she carried the
13312,stories of Isaac Babel . After lunch we
13313,went to the pictures . Philip allowed
13314,# it to be seen that he thought going to
13315,the pictures just for the fun of it was
13316,For his sake we chose the more
13317,serious of the two films that were
13318,showing in the little town . It was
13319,about a good priest who helped cri-
13320,"minals in New York . His goodness , how-"
13321,"ever , was not enough to prevent one"
13322,of them from being sent to the gas
13323,chamber ; and Philip and I waited with
13324,Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
13325,crying and could face the light of a golden
13326,evening .
13327,At the entrance of the cinema the
13328,doorman was lying in wait for anyone
13329,who had red eyes . Grasping Catherine
13330,"by her suffering arm , he said bitterly :"
13331,"' Yes , why are you crying , he had to be"
13332,"punished for his crime , didn't he ? ' Cathe-"
13333,"rine stared at him , incredulous . Philip"
13334,rescued her by saying with disdain :
13335,' Some people don't know right from wrong
13336,even when its demonstrated to them . '
13337,The doorman turned his attention
13338,to the next red-eyed emerger from the
13339,dark ; and we went on together to
13340,"the station , the children silent because"
13341,of the cruelty of the world . Finally Catherine
13342,"said , her eyes wet again : ' I think its all"
13343,"absolutely beastly , and I can't bear to think"
13344,about it . ' And Philip said : ' But we 've got
13345,"to think about it , don't you see , because"
13346,"if we don't it 'll just go on and on , don't"
13347,you see ? '
13348,In the train going back to London I sat
13349,beside # Catherine . She had the stories open
13350,"in front of her , but she said : ' Philip 's awfully lucky ."
13351,I wish I went to that school . Did you notice
13352,that girl who said hullo to him in the garden ?
